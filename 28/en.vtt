18:40.548 --> 18:42.651
They said seven, so...

18:44.186 --> 18:45.188

18:45.324 --> 18:47.491

And what's that?

19:02.275 --> 19:04.674
To not care about nothin'. Hey!

19:04.809 --> 19:08.042
Dingy, tell them guys to
get their bikes off the grass.

19:08.177 --> 19:10.712
Jeez. Hmm.

19:10.847 --> 19:13.682
I mean, my ex in-laws live
right across the street.

19:13.817 --> 19:15.585
You know, they see these bikes
here all the time.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.981
Hey, so, uh, tell me more
about Johnny.

19:18.117 --> 19:20.026
- Like what?
- I don't know.

19:20.161 --> 19:21.687
Like, uh,
how he started the club.

19:21.822 --> 19:23.161
You know how
he started the club?

19:23.296 --> 19:24.826
I heard he was watchin', uh, TV.

19:24.961 --> 19:27.462
You know, Johnny's not like
the rest of these guys.

19:27.597 --> 19:28.995
You know, how they're all bums.

19:29.131 --> 19:30.764
I mean, he's not
a-a square or nothin',

19:30.899 --> 19:32.604
but Johnny's got a good job,
you know?

19:32.740 --> 19:34.765
He's had the same job as long
as I've known about him.

19:34.901 --> 19:36.502
- What was that?
- Truck driver.

19:36.637 --> 19:38.069
He's a truck driver.

19:38.204 --> 19:39.837
Yeah, short routes, you know?
Like the Midwest.

19:39.972 --> 19:41.472
But, I mean, he's got a family.

19:41.608 --> 19:42.542
- Right.
- Yeah.

19:42.677 --> 19:44.444
Two daughters. His wife, Betty.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.052
She's all right, you know.

19:46.187 --> 19:47.917
I mean,
a lot of these girls, oof,

19:48.052 --> 19:50.755
I can't stand to be around
because it's always, you know,

19:50.890 --> 19:54.258
"That's my man, don't be
lookin' at my man," you know?

19:54.393 --> 19:55.890
But Betty, she's not like that.

19:56.025 --> 20:00.058
Hey. What do you mean by,
um, Johnny was watching TV?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.628
<i>He was watchin', uh,
Marlon Brando on TV</i>

20:03.764 --> 20:05.767
<i>and got the idea for the club.</i>

20:05.902 --> 20:07.470
<i>I mean, that's what
I heard anyway.</i>

20:07.606 --> 20:09.672
- Girls, girls...

20:09.807 --> 20:11.207
Somebody tell me
what that means.

20:11.342 --> 20:12.736
BRMC. What does that mean?

20:12.872 --> 20:14.511
Black Rebels Motorcycle Club.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.382
-  Isn't that cute?

20:16.518 --> 20:19.245
Hey, Johnny, what are you
rebelling against?

20:19.381 --> 20:20.247
Whattya got?

20:21.714 --> 20:23.746
Hmm. Whattya got?

20:23.882 --> 20:25.721
- What?
- Hmm.

20:26.894 --> 20:27.789
Nothin'.

20:28.991 --> 20:30.523
<i>Oh, but really
how the club started</i>

20:30.658 --> 20:32.095
<i>was it was a racing club.</i>

20:51.450 --> 20:53.447
<i>I never seen Johnny race,</i>

20:53.582 --> 20:54.816
<i>but they say he was good.</i>

20:54.951 --> 20:56.284
<i>You know,
him and Jimmy Goodpaster</i>

20:56.420 --> 20:58.254
<i>had a-a racing club.</i>

20:58.390 --> 20:59.451
- Goodpaster?
-Yeah.

20:59.586 --> 21:01.153
You know him.

21:01.288 --> 21:04.259
He's got that, uh, that
BSA shop out past Hyde Park.

21:04.394 --> 21:05.425
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.827
- Mustache.
- What?

21:06.962 --> 21:08.468
- He's got a thin mustache.
-Yeah.

21:08.603 --> 21:10.468
Yeah, well, they, uh, they had
a racing club together.

21:10.604 --> 21:13.672
I'm thinking of startin'
a riding club.

21:13.807 --> 21:15.299
Why?

21:15.434 --> 21:17.475
I don't know.
Just somethin' to do, you know.

21:17.611 --> 21:19.611
The fuck you wanna
start a ridin' club for?

21:19.747 --> 21:23.207
All those clubs do is sit around
talking about motorcycles.

21:24.448 --> 21:25.980
That's what we do.

21:26.115 --> 21:28.177
Yeah, we talk about 'em,
and then we race 'em.

21:28.313 --> 21:29.650
The fuck good you do
to talk about 'em

21:29.785 --> 21:31.248
if you ain't gonna race 'em?

21:31.384 --> 21:34.388
So they split up,
and about, uh, about 12 guys

21:34.524 --> 21:35.456
joined up to be Vandals.

21:35.592 --> 21:36.853
They were the first, you know?

21:36.989 --> 21:38.055
So that's where the guys--

21:38.191 --> 21:39.564
I mean,
the first guys at least--

21:39.699 --> 21:40.966
that's where the first guys,
uh, come from,

21:41.102 --> 21:42.167
was the racin' club.

21:42.303 --> 21:43.265
-Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.194
And who all was that?

21:45.330 --> 21:48.032
Well, it was Wahoo and Corky.
I know that.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.141
<i>My name's Wahoo.</i>

21:50.276 --> 21:51.902
I ride a Harley Duo-Glide.

21:52.037 --> 21:54.041
I'm from Chicago, Illinois.

21:54.176 --> 21:56.647
I've been a Vandal
for about five years now.

21:57.612 --> 21:58.941
They call me Corky.

21:59.077 --> 22:00.286
I ride Wahoo's old lady.

22:00.421 --> 22:02.712
- Oh, the fuck you do, fuck.

22:02.847 --> 22:04.015
He doesn't.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.821
<i>And Brucie was one of 'em.</i>

22:05.956 --> 22:07.719
<i>He was Johnny's right hand
from the beginning.</i>

22:07.854 --> 22:09.429
<i>He was an electrician.</i>

22:09.564 --> 22:11.728
But everyone wants
to be part of somethin'.

22:13.161 --> 22:15.532
I mean,
that's what it really is.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.302
These guys don't belong
nowhere else,

22:17.437 --> 22:19.835
so they belong together,
you know.

22:21.134 --> 22:22.540
I can't explain it
to my parents.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.038
They-they don't understand
the way I live.

22:26.245 --> 22:27.876
Because bikeriders...

22:29.647 --> 22:31.341
Lotta people seem to think

22:31.476 --> 22:33.719
that bikes lead
to somethin' negative.

22:34.822 --> 22:36.554
That's-that's why they think
guys ride 'em.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.224
They think it leads
to somethin' obscene.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.054
I don't know why, but, uh...

22:42.257 --> 22:45.355
...but obscenity and motorcycles
travel hand in hand.

22:46.534 --> 22:48.327
That's what everybody
thinks anyway.

22:48.462 --> 22:49.330
Why?

22:49.466 --> 22:52.128
I guess, uh...

22:52.264 --> 22:54.606
everybody needs somebody
to pick on.

22:56.335 --> 22:58.039
Can you think of anyone
better than us?

23:00.709 --> 23:02.205
Well, Cal from California.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.746
I look at a scooter, man,

23:03.882 --> 23:07.212
that's completely chopped, man,
and-and...

23:07.347 --> 23:09.884
and every part on it,
he either made himself, man,

23:10.019 --> 23:11.253
or bought special for it,
you know.

23:12.789 --> 23:13.951
Now, y-you look
at that dude, man,

23:14.087 --> 23:15.725
that dude's a Vandal, you see.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.364
Let's say you, uh...
say you take a-a guy

23:18.499 --> 23:20.758
that buys
a brand-new Harley-Davidson,

23:20.893 --> 23:22.898
fully equipped. Hmm?

23:24.268 --> 23:28.232
Though, there'll always be
a motherfucker that comes along

23:28.368 --> 23:31.444
and says, "Well, I got one
exactly like yours."

23:31.579 --> 23:34.079
- 'Cause he can get it

23:34.214 --> 23:35.379
exactly like his.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.612
But all choppers are different.

23:37.747 --> 23:39.012
Every one of 'em, different.

23:39.147 --> 23:41.144
No matter how much alike
you build 'em,

23:41.279 --> 23:42.687
- you know what I mean?
- Mm.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.016
'Cause everybody's
melon's different.

23:44.152 --> 23:47.389
<i>When I was about 15 years old,</i>

23:47.524 --> 23:48.792
my father brought me

23:48.927 --> 23:50.893
- an Indian four-cylinder.

23:51.758 --> 23:53.131
Motorcycle.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.361
I like to be dirty.

23:55.496 --> 23:57.931
Yeah, I'll go out of my way
to put filth on my clothes.

23:58.067 --> 23:59.996
Dirt on my pants,
dirt on my face,

24:00.132 --> 24:02.674
mess up my hair and eat bugs.

24:03.873 --> 24:05.344
A bug isn't really bad to eat.

24:05.479 --> 24:06.940
It's all in a person's mind.

24:07.076 --> 24:08.939
Now, if you will eat
a raw beef sandwich

24:09.075 --> 24:11.448
or you will eat a rare steak,

24:11.584 --> 24:12.942
a bug won't hurt you anymore.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.515
And what about Zipco?

24:14.650 --> 24:15.880
What about Zipco?

24:16.016 --> 24:17.914
You know anything about him?

24:18.050 --> 24:19.024
Oh, he was from Latvia.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.293
- Yeah.
- Right.

24:20.429 --> 24:22.987
Do you know
when he joined the club?

24:23.123 --> 24:24.794
Zipco? I mean, I don't know.

24:24.929 --> 24:26.495
He's just always been there.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.233
DANNY
So, uh,

24:28.368 --> 24:30.330
tell me more about Johnny.

24:30.466 --> 24:31.637
What?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.208
<i>I never understood it,
you know.</i>

24:36.344 --> 24:37.342
<i>You got all these guys,</i>

24:37.478 --> 24:38.973
none of 'em can follow a rule

24:39.109 --> 24:40.344
- to save der lives, you know.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.845
The whole point of these guys

24:41.980 --> 24:43.913
is that they can't
follow rules, you know.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.585
You put 'em together,
and they get in this club,

24:45.720 --> 24:47.552
and all of a sudden,
oh, they start makin' up

24:47.688 --> 24:49.013
all these rules
for everybody to follow.

24:49.148 --> 24:50.557
It's ridiculous.

24:50.692 --> 24:52.218
I mean, it's absolutely
ridiculous, you know?

24:52.354 --> 24:54.385
But this one time,
someone challenged Johnny

24:54.520 --> 24:56.354
for the leadership
of the club, you know.

24:56.489 --> 24:58.325
That's one of these, uh,
these crazy rules

24:58.460 --> 25:01.029
is that anybody can challenge
Johnny if they really want to,

25:01.164 --> 25:02.700
but of course, you know,
none of 'em want to

25:02.835 --> 25:04.130
'cause they're all bums,
you know,

25:04.265 --> 25:05.305
and none of 'em
want the responsibility.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.305
But this one time,
this guy Jack,

25:07.441 --> 25:08.707
big guy, I mean, real big guy,

25:08.843 --> 25:10.640
I mean, you know,
Big Jack they called him.

25:10.775 --> 25:12.344
-Fat Jack.
- What?

25:12.479 --> 25:13.740
- Wasn't it Fat Jack?
- No.

25:13.876 --> 25:15.174
He was the one outta Toledo.

25:15.309 --> 25:17.044
This guy was, uh...
Well, I don't know.

25:17.180 --> 25:19.515
Anyway, this Big Fat Jack
guy says...

25:19.650 --> 25:21.011
Hey, I got a question!

25:21.147 --> 25:23.221
Wait your turn! Let me finish.

25:25.517 --> 25:27.192
Now, we're gonna
get the phone installed

25:27.327 --> 25:29.123
behind the bar dere,

25:29.258 --> 25:31.122
but Johnny has to put that
on his personal account.

25:31.258 --> 25:33.292
- Why's he gotta do that?
- So...

25:33.427 --> 25:34.765
I don't...
Because that's the way

25:34.900 --> 25:36.063
the phone company
has to set it up.

25:36.199 --> 25:37.331
Club should pay for it
outta the dues.

25:37.467 --> 25:38.569
Yeah.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.102
That way, we can use it
how we want.

25:40.237 --> 25:41.373
- It don't work like that.
-Why not?

26:24.282 --> 26:25.476

33:48.354 --> 33:50.128
college boy.

and short pants,

33:51.922 --> 33:53.563

34:01.866 --> 34:03.904
they wouldn't take me, you know.

34:04.039 --> 34:07.705
They took him 'cause he's
a clean-cut, all-American boy.

34:07.841 --> 34:10.242
You know, short pants
and tennis shoes.

34:10.377 --> 34:12.075
I gotta take a piss.

34:12.210 --> 34:15.044
I told my brother...
He went to college one year.

34:15.179 --> 34:19.155
I said, "Fucker,
you don't quit that college,

34:19.290 --> 34:21.284
I'mma beat the shit outta you."

34:21.420 --> 34:23.287
And he quit.

34:23.422 --> 34:26.088
'Cause I told him I don't want
no goddamn pinkos in my family.

34:26.223 --> 34:29.258
'Cause I can't stand
that shit, you know.

34:29.394 --> 34:31.067
'Cause if you can't work
with your fuckin' hands,

34:31.203 --> 34:32.572

34:51.615 --> 34:53.456

34:54.886 --> 34:56.486
- What do you do?

34:56.621 --> 34:59.095
I study photography.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.925
- In college.

35:04.104 --> 35:05.734
Why'd you scratch my bike?

35:05.869 --> 35:08.403
I didn't scratch

35:13.577 --> 35:16.072
- Scratch?
- What's goin' on?

35:17.285 --> 35:20.116
Man, I was looking

35:23.582 --> 35:24.947
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.118
And now he says
I scratched his bike.

35:27.254 --> 35:28.656
Whoa.

35:28.791 --> 35:30.388
I didn't scratch

37:54.300 --> 37:56.606
That kid's fuckin' crazy.

37:57.910 --> 37:58.801
Yeah.

37:58.937 --> 37:59.835
- Fuck this.

37:59.970 --> 38:01.479
Let's get some beers.

38:02.512 --> 38:04.350
- Come on.

38:09.519 --> 38:11.189
Well, I had... I had four carbs

38:11.325 --> 38:14.622
and, uh, 80 cubic inches
per engine,

38:14.758 --> 38:17.755
two-inch valves,
all ported and relieved,

38:17.890 --> 38:20.332
and, uh, I had the biggest cams,

38:20.467 --> 38:23.028
the hairiest cams
I could put in there, man.

38:23.995 --> 38:25.464
How the fuck did you start it?

38:25.600 --> 38:27.170
My mechanic.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.034
He weighed 300 pounds.

38:29.169 --> 38:31.407
He started it. One kick
and that fucker started.

38:31.542 --> 38:33.037
ZIPCO
Fuck.

38:33.172 --> 38:35.641
You know how to time stuff
pretty good, huh?

38:35.776 --> 38:37.516
Pretty good. I mean, all right.

38:37.651 --> 38:39.881
Enough for me, you know.
I'm the one ridin' it.

38:40.016 --> 38:41.520
Yeah, but, see,
here's the problem.

38:41.655 --> 38:43.178
Then you gotta bring
that fat guy with you ridin'.

38:43.314 --> 38:45.556
- And you gotta feed him.

38:47.989 --> 38:49.895
Whatta you thinkin' back there?

38:50.031 --> 38:50.990
What?

38:52.325 --> 38:56.193
Right there, when you-you come
chargin' in like that?

38:58.331 --> 39:00.897
Nothin'. I saw you
squarin' off with them guys.

39:01.032 --> 39:02.837
What I'd need to think for?

39:05.978 --> 39:07.105
Yeah.

39:08.082 --> 39:09.745
Yeah, you and me, kid.

39:12.252 --> 39:14.013
You and me, you crazy fuck.

39:17.783 --> 39:19.249
- Mm.
- Yeah.

39:22.662 --> 39:24.353
<i>Well,
Benny's always been a fighter.</i>

39:24.488 --> 39:26.262
And that's just
what they need in that club.

39:26.397 --> 39:27.763
Because you know what?

39:27.898 --> 39:29.865
- Half them guys in there
are candy ass.
- Hmm.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.603
There's a lotta guys in there
that are candy ass.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.403
- Can you walk with that thing?
- Yep.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.137
I mean, candy asses.

39:37.272 --> 39:39.872
They'll just as soon turn around
than get into a fight.

39:40.007 --> 39:41.311
They don't care
if they go to jail

39:41.447 --> 39:42.644
for disturbin' the peace.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.143
No, but they ain't
gonna go to jail

39:44.278 --> 39:46.241
for aggravated assault
or nothin' like that.

39:46.377 --> 39:49.019
- Will you move those bikes?

39:49.154 --> 39:50.088
Yes, ma'am.

39:50.224 --> 39:51.853
Oh, wow. You, uh...

39:51.989 --> 39:54.584
You left me one beer
out of a whole case of bottles.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.789
What saints.

39:55.925 --> 39:57.220
MAN
From Bell, California,

39:57.355 --> 39:58.926
- here is Richard Connelly.

40:01.059 --> 40:03.502
Get these bikes off my yard!

40:04.569 --> 40:05.931
I mean, Benny's not even here,

40:06.066 --> 40:07.803
and all these jerks
are out in front.

40:07.938 --> 40:09.265
I mean, 'cause they got
no place to go, see?

40:09.401 --> 40:11.000
So they'll come
and they'll sit here.

40:11.135 --> 40:12.511
And it makes the place look bad.

40:12.646 --> 40:15.481
I mean, the neighbors see it,
and this and that.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.817
I used to be respectable.

40:24.391 --> 40:26.154
Kathy, why do you think
the guys,

40:26.290 --> 40:28.824
they don't wear their colors
when they're not all together?

40:29.621 --> 40:31.423
Why?

40:31.559 --> 40:33.456
'Cause they're afraid
when they're all by themselves.

40:33.591 --> 40:34.956
'Cause too many people
are after 'em,

40:35.092 --> 40:36.324
for one thing, you know.

40:36.460 --> 40:37.698
Too many people
got a grudge against them.

40:37.834 --> 40:39.328
So if they catch 'em
one by one--

40:39.463 --> 40:41.168
I mean,
that's what happened to Benny.

40:41.304 --> 40:43.872
Benny always wore his colors,
and when he did wear his colors

40:44.007 --> 40:45.710
and he was by himself,
there was trouble.

40:45.846 --> 40:47.269
I mean, you heard about
all the trouble he got in

40:47.404 --> 40:48.914
- over at the Lakeside Inn?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:49.049 --> 40:50.444
And that was it.

40:50.579 --> 40:51.946
Benny was by himself

40:52.081 --> 40:54.419
and wouldn't take
his colors off for nobody.

40:54.555 --> 40:55.812
And there was trouble.

40:55.947 --> 40:57.480
You hear my brother?

40:57.615 --> 40:59.921
Can't be wearin' no colors
in this neighborhood.

41:04.597 --> 41:05.823
Paulie, he won't stay down.

41:05.958 --> 41:07.722
Keeps getting back up.

41:09.294 --> 41:10.201
You better stay down,
you rotten fuck.

41:10.337 --> 41:12.327
I'll get him to stay down.

41:12.463 --> 41:14.401
Is this
your fucking bike, asshole?

41:16.170 --> 41:17.503
- Oh, shit. Henry!

41:19.512 --> 41:21.336
You motherfucker!

41:21.472 --> 41:23.279
- Oh, you dirty cocksucker!
-Henry!

41:23.415 --> 41:24.874
- Henry.

41:25.009 --> 41:26.142
Yeah, don't worry.

41:26.278 --> 41:28.017
I got this motherfucker
right here.

41:37.894 --> 41:40.093
I mean,
it nearly took his foot off.

41:41.027 --> 41:42.829
You know, my dad always told me

41:42.964 --> 41:44.927
it takes a lot
to make a man cry,

41:45.063 --> 41:46.839
an awful lot, you know.

41:46.974 --> 41:49.975
I mean, they don't get hit
on the head and start cryin'.

41:50.110 --> 41:51.203
Not a real man.

41:52.336 --> 41:54.640
Well, I've seen my father cry

41:54.775 --> 41:57.039
twice in all my life.

41:57.175 --> 41:58.682
Once when his father died

41:58.817 --> 42:00.384
and once when
my mother almost died.

42:00.519 --> 42:02.418
And I mean really cry, you know.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.022
And I always believed him.

42:04.158 --> 42:06.219
Whereas Benny,

42:06.354 --> 42:09.560
I've seen him getting
worked over with blackjacks.

42:09.696 --> 42:11.054
I've seen him
gettin' stitched up

42:11.189 --> 42:12.798
with no nothin', you know.

42:12.933 --> 42:14.358
I mean, it's just like,
just like stitchin' him up

42:14.493 --> 42:16.062
while he's wide awake
and everythin' else.

42:16.198 --> 42:18.869
You don't see that guy
shed a tear.

42:19.004 --> 42:22.872
The closest I ever seen him
come to it was that day. Mm.

42:24.137 --> 42:26.540
Not for the pain or nothin', no.

42:26.675 --> 42:28.713
You know what it was?

42:34.822 --> 42:38.382
<i>
Don't let 'em take my foot.</i>

42:39.452 --> 42:40.917
- All right? You don't let 'em

42:41.052 --> 42:42.484
take my foot off.

42:45.130 --> 42:48.128
They take my foot off,
and I can't ride no more.

42:51.669 --> 42:52.800
<i>That was it.</i>

42:52.935 --> 42:54.431
He didn't want to lose his foot

42:54.566 --> 42:56.233
'cause then he couldn't
ride no more.

42:56.368 --> 42:58.071
Never mind
that he-he got a concussion

42:58.206 --> 42:59.904
and this maniac
nearly chopped his foot off

43:00.040 --> 43:01.202
for not taking his colors off.

43:01.338 --> 43:03.109
No, never mind that he...

43:03.244 --> 43:04.615
He wasn't even
supposed to be ridin'

43:04.751 --> 43:06.212
'cause his license
had been suspended

43:06.347 --> 43:08.010
from that one time
the cops chased him all over.

43:08.145 --> 43:10.451
I mean...

43:10.586 --> 43:12.291
No, no, no, no.

43:12.426 --> 43:13.515
I mean, all he could think about

43:13.650 --> 43:15.189
was ridin'
his stupid motorcycle.

43:15.324 --> 43:18.426
I tell ya, you know,
be funny if it wasn't so tragic.

43:19.795 --> 43:22.096
And what about Johnny?

43:24.567 --> 43:26.232
Oh, Johnny.

43:27.241 --> 43:28.905
Johnny went crazy.

43:29.974 --> 43:32.640
Johnny, Benny is in a bad way.

43:32.775 --> 43:34.006
He's in the hospital.

43:34.142 --> 43:36.605
Two guys jumped him
over his colors.

43:38.948 --> 43:40.678
They nearly
chopped his foot off.

43:47.952 --> 43:49.354
Where?

43:51.022 --> 43:52.192
Lakeside.

44:47.819 --> 44:49.953
I don't want any trouble here.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.090
Well, um...

44:56.854 --> 44:59.864
Young kid get beat up
in here earlier today.

45:01.663 --> 45:02.894
And, ah...

45:03.029 --> 45:05.067
You know who did it?

45:09.343 --> 45:11.073
Couple of regulars.

45:13.006 --> 45:14.747
A couple regulars?

45:16.107 --> 45:17.942
Yeah, all right.

45:18.077 --> 45:20.113
Take that pencil,

45:20.249 --> 45:22.821
write their names down,
where they live.

45:24.789 --> 45:26.715
Then I'll let you leave.

45:29.530 --> 45:31.896
This is my bar. I own it.

46:12.064 --> 46:13.265
Send a few guys,

46:13.401 --> 46:15.698
make it so they can't
walk no more.

46:19.006 --> 46:20.773
What about the bar?

46:20.908 --> 46:22.276

You know, that's a lot of power
for one guy to have.

47:46.725 --> 47:48.691
You know,
to be in charge of alla that.

47:48.827 --> 47:50.391
I mean, that can really mess
with your noodle.

47:50.527 --> 47:53.235
- Cream?
-No.

47:59.504 --> 48:01.474
You know, Benny was bad off.

48:04.315 --> 48:06.178
Now, I had him in a motel
for three weeks.

48:06.314 --> 48:07.609
I mean, he couldn't walk,

48:07.745 --> 48:09.854
so I got him a place
with no stairs.

48:09.990 --> 48:12.221
This is my husband. This is...

48:13.090 --> 48:14.425
-Darrin.

48:15.886 --> 48:16.891
Oh, we were
just having a drink.

48:17.027 --> 48:18.591
Would you care for a cocktail?

48:18.726 --> 48:20.631
- I'd like a very dry martini.

48:20.767 --> 48:22.625
Italian Vermouth, Spanish gin

48:22.760 --> 48:24.497
- and a Greek olive?

48:24.632 --> 48:26.003
Well, I don't think
we have any of...

48:26.139 --> 48:27.934
-Don't bother.

48:28.070 --> 48:29.507
I'll fix it myself.

48:39.717 --> 48:40.648
Hey, Kathy.

48:40.784 --> 48:42.779
Come on in.

48:43.953 --> 48:45.390
Hey, look at you.

48:45.525 --> 48:46.886
All propped up.

48:47.021 --> 48:48.153
Like the queen.

48:48.289 --> 48:49.953
Who you callin' a queen?

48:50.088 --> 48:52.854
Ah, you look good.
You're looking all right.

48:52.990 --> 48:54.524
The guys thought
you might really be out of it.

48:54.659 --> 48:56.925
He is out of it. He can't walk.

48:57.595 --> 48:58.835
What'd the surgeon say?

48:58.970 --> 49:01.671
They, uh, cut through a tendon.

49:01.806 --> 49:02.971
Oh, Jesus.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.334
We're outta ice.

49:04.470 --> 49:05.569
Oh, yeah.

49:05.705 --> 49:07.111
They tie it back together
or what?

49:07.246 --> 49:08.473
-Somethin' like that.
-Mm-hmm.

49:08.609 --> 49:10.982
- I'm gonna go get some ice.
- So, uh...

49:11.118 --> 49:13.009
So, how long they keep you
in the hospital for?

49:13.144 --> 49:15.647
-Three or four days.
-That's a long time.

49:29.301 --> 49:31.232
The guys would love
to see you out there.

49:31.368 --> 49:32.967
It's gonna be a big one,
you know,

49:33.102 --> 49:34.373
maybe the biggest one yet.

49:34.508 --> 49:36.164
Biggest what?

49:36.300 --> 49:37.641
Picnic. Johnny's sayin'
they're goin' all out

49:37.776 --> 49:38.705
for the Dayton run.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.669
Oh.

49:40.805 --> 49:42.271
How long is that? Three weeks?

49:42.406 --> 49:44.040
Yeah.

49:44.176 --> 49:45.481
I mean, I'll still be
in the cast by then, but...

49:45.617 --> 49:46.984
Cast?

49:47.120 --> 49:48.479
Cast, nah.
You shift with your left foot.

49:48.614 --> 49:49.844
You can always
use your front brake

49:49.980 --> 49:52.123
if you can't put
no pressure on it.

49:52.991 --> 49:54.350
I know the guys, they would...

50:02.494 --> 50:04.392
You want a drink Johnny?

50:04.528 --> 50:06.036
I'm good.

50:06.172 --> 50:08.238
The guys would love
to see ya out there.

50:09.275 --> 50:10.999
You know,
they're real worried about ya.

50:11.868 --> 50:14.640
- I'll be there.
- All right.

50:16.310 --> 50:17.307
I'll get out of here.

50:17.442 --> 50:19.746
I'll let you rest.

50:19.882 --> 50:21.353
Okay.

50:21.488 --> 50:23.319
Kathy.

50:36.059 --> 50:37.432
I mean, you wouldn't
really try riding

50:37.567 --> 50:39.237
- after three weeks, would ya?

50:39.373 --> 50:41.396
The doctor said three to four
months with no weight on it.

50:41.532 --> 50:42.498
I don't know.

50:42.634 --> 50:44.606
Turn up the TV, will you?

50:47.244 --> 50:48.872
I don't want you ridin'.

50:50.878 --> 50:53.409
Yeah, it scares me, especially
this soon after surgery.

50:53.544 --> 50:55.384
I-I don't like it.

50:57.091 --> 50:59.586
- You don't like it?
- I get worried.

51:06.227 --> 51:07.891
I should just go.

51:09.363 --> 51:10.858
I'm just gonna leave.

51:10.994 --> 51:12.960
- What?
- No, it's better.

51:13.096 --> 51:15.102
- You'd be better off.
- Stop. Stop it.

51:15.238 --> 51:17.466
Not having to take care of me.

51:17.602 --> 51:18.937
- Worry about me.
- No.

51:19.072 --> 51:20.904
No.

51:21.915 --> 51:24.545
When I heal up, I'll leave.

51:55.982 --> 51:58.007
I don't want you to go.

52:19.430 --> 52:22.800
I'm going off the freeway
into this, uh, ice plant.

52:22.936 --> 52:24.271
I don't know if you know
what ice plant is.

52:24.407 --> 52:25.769
If you're ever in California,

52:25.904 --> 52:27.138
stop and look if you want,
but, like...

52:27.274 --> 52:28.375
Hey, Kathy.

52:28.511 --> 52:30.340
Hey, Brucie. How's Gail?

52:30.475 --> 52:32.915
She's good. She's, uh, got
a job doin' nails in Oak Park.

52:33.050 --> 52:34.180
I'll go see her.

52:34.316 --> 52:35.849
Uh, Johnny, can we talk?

52:35.984 --> 52:38.014
Mm.

52:40.352 --> 52:42.919
Oh, you always gotta have these
guys around to hear everything?

52:43.055 --> 52:45.221
- Well, what's there to hear?
- Some things.

52:45.356 --> 52:46.495
Oh.

52:56.372 --> 52:58.210
You need somethin', Kathy?

53:01.310 --> 53:02.370
You can't have him.

53:02.505 --> 53:03.876
Who?

53:04.011 --> 53:05.708
You know exactly
who I'm talkin' about.

53:05.843 --> 53:07.185
Benny. You can't have him.

53:07.321 --> 53:08.881
The club can't have him.
He's mine.

53:09.017 --> 53:10.722
You know, and if he keeps
ridin' motorcycles,

53:10.857 --> 53:12.046
he's gonna die.

53:12.182 --> 53:13.286
One way or another,
it'll kill him.

53:13.421 --> 53:14.685
And you know this is true.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.561
What am I supposed
to do about it?

53:16.696 --> 53:20.398
You know I don't run Benny,
just like you don't run Benny.

53:20.533 --> 53:23.360
There ain't nobody
can tell that kid nothin'.

53:23.495 --> 53:25.193
He's grown.

53:26.330 --> 53:28.765
If he wants to ride a bike,
he'll ride a bike.

53:28.900 --> 53:30.274
Well, not if you tell him,
Johnny.

53:30.410 --> 53:31.704
Not if you tell him
he's outta the club.

53:31.839 --> 53:34.472
- Come on.
- No, he's mine, Johnny. Mine.

53:34.608 --> 53:35.704
I'm his wife, not you.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.445
Fuck is that supposed to mean?

53:37.581 --> 53:39.115
Well, I know you love him.
I love him, too.

53:39.251 --> 53:41.552
That's why you gotta do this.

53:43.855 --> 53:45.884
Uh...

53:48.159 --> 53:49.954
Are you, are you done?

53:51.360 --> 53:52.459
I don't know. Am I?

53:52.594 --> 53:53.621
Oh, you got
anything more to say?

53:53.757 --> 53:54.890
No, I said it.

53:55.026 --> 53:56.734
All right, then,
you know, y-you are.

53:56.870 --> 53:58.263
You're...

53:58.398 --> 53:59.568
You're done.

54:11.580 --> 54:13.175
You can't have him!

54:21.394 --> 54:23.820
MAN
Shut the fuck up!

54:23.955 --> 54:26.089
Why don't you try it?

54:28.632 --> 54:30.167
Shut your fuckin' yap!

54:30.303 --> 54:32.495
I swear to God,
all you do is bitch.

54:32.631 --> 54:34.472
Yap, yap, yap!

54:34.607 --> 54:36.604
I oughta shut that fuckin'
mouth of yours for good.

54:36.740 --> 54:38.033
If you did,
it'd be the first thing

54:38.169 --> 54:39.670
- you ever finished...
- Quit the racket!

54:39.806 --> 54:40.969
I'm sick of that mouth on you.

54:41.104 --> 54:42.545
...worthless piece of shit!

54:42.681 --> 54:44.646
Always acting like
you're so fuckin' tough!

54:44.782 --> 54:46.384
If it wasn't for my bad back,
I'd have beat

54:46.519 --> 54:48.009
- your ass blue by now!
- Yeah, lemme get my jacket.

54:48.144 --> 54:49.452
My back! My back!

54:49.587 --> 54:50.815
- I said to quit the racket.
-Come here!

54:50.951 --> 54:52.324
What a worthless
piece of shit...

54:52.459 --> 54:53.585
Come here! I'm gonna put
this belt on you!

54:53.721 --> 54:54.750
...you turned out to be!

54:54.886 --> 54:56.119
- No, no, no!
- Take that!

54:56.254 --> 54:57.422
- I said, quit the racket!
-Told you!

54:57.557 --> 54:59.093
- I told you!
- Fuck!

55:00.463 --> 55:02.256
- Told you, huh?

55:02.392 --> 55:03.958
- I told you. Didn't I?
-No.

55:04.094 --> 55:05.827
- Quit it! Quit it!
-No!

55:05.963 --> 55:07.004
- No!

55:07.139 --> 55:09.501
Hey, come here. Come here.

55:09.637 --> 55:11.076
- Come on.
-Stop!

55:11.211 --> 55:12.539
- Stop it!

55:12.674 --> 55:15.572
Stop it! You're gonna kill him!

55:15.707 --> 55:18.815
Stop it! Stop it!

55:21.483 --> 55:23.312
I want you outta here!

55:23.447 --> 55:26.721
Don't you ever come back here!
Don't you ever!

55:35.059 --> 55:36.362
WOMAN
I'm sorry.

55:36.498 --> 55:39.001
I'm sorry.

55:39.136 --> 55:40.331
I'm sorry.

55:40.466 --> 55:41.703
Sorry.

55:50.150 --> 55:51.840
Who's comin'?

56:17.671 --> 56:18.570
What's the matter?

56:27.978 --> 56:29.421
Hey, hey.

56:31.650 --> 56:33.418
You a Vandal?

56:33.554 --> 56:34.588
That's right.

56:34.723 --> 56:35.922
All right, well,
me and the guys,

56:36.057 --> 56:38.095
you know,
we're looking to join up.

56:38.231 --> 56:39.591
- You wanna join...
- Uh-huh.

56:39.727 --> 56:41.466
...you gotta talk to the man.

56:42.268 --> 56:43.963
Oh, yeah? Who's the man?

56:45.071 --> 56:46.900
Who's the man?

56:51.704 --> 56:53.478
That's the man.

56:56.113 --> 56:57.482
Come on.

56:59.218 --> 57:01.748
Hey, look at this guy.

57:01.884 --> 57:03.286
-Hey, welcome back.
-Wow.

57:03.421 --> 57:05.452
You rode in all the way on that?

57:05.587 --> 57:06.819
I strapped it to the bike.

57:06.955 --> 57:08.292
He needs it
'cause his leg is broke.

57:08.427 --> 57:09.520
- Hey, Betty.
-Hey, Kathy.

57:09.655 --> 57:11.519
I need a drink.

57:11.654 --> 57:14.097
So, uh, what's it like
ridin' on the old foot?

57:32.084 --> 57:33.144
Hey, man.

57:34.314 --> 57:36.345
Somebody told me you're the guy
I need to talk to.

57:38.551 --> 57:39.717
Maybe.

57:39.853 --> 57:42.484
Blew out here from California.

57:42.619 --> 57:45.626
Heard there was a big picnic,
wanted to check it out.

57:45.761 --> 57:48.027
Heard you're the man in charge.

57:48.925 --> 57:50.562
I'm Sonny.

57:50.698 --> 57:52.295
I was hoping maybe to...

57:53.197 --> 57:55.364
...little food,
little to drink...

57:56.309 --> 57:58.808
...camp out for a night or two.

57:58.943 --> 58:01.106
Wanted to show a little class,
contribute to the party.

58:02.073 --> 58:04.312
All right. Help yourself.

58:04.448 --> 58:05.680
This here's Brucie.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.514
This, uh, Benny right there
with the boot.

58:08.649 --> 58:10.549
And I'm Johnny.

58:10.685 --> 58:12.154
We're the Vandals.

58:12.290 --> 58:13.690
Well...

58:14.793 --> 58:16.693
...it's nice to meet
some proper fuck-ups.

58:27.266 --> 58:28.635

58:28.770 --> 58:30.707

58:38.779 --> 58:40.915
Vandals, motherfucker!

58:41.982 --> 58:43.245
I always wondered

58:43.381 --> 58:45.953
what riders out in California
looked like.

58:46.088 --> 58:48.555
Can you imagine a thousand
of those fucking guys?

58:48.691 --> 58:51.056

59:01.300 --> 59:03.366
Oh, they always
pegged me for stupid.

59:03.501 --> 59:05.934
Man, I couldn't read
a fuckin' comic book

59:06.070 --> 59:07.605
until I was in the army.

59:07.740 --> 59:09.873
What comic book?

59:10.008 --> 59:12.016
I was born in Canada, man.

59:12.151 --> 59:13.441
Come on, I mean,

59:13.577 --> 59:15.779
I went up to the fourth grade,
man, in school,

59:15.915 --> 59:17.212
all French, no English.

59:17.348 --> 59:18.953
And I was,
I was always hasslin'

59:19.089 --> 59:21.216
and just tryin' to learn
the goddamn language.

59:21.352 --> 59:23.384
- You were in the army?
- Yeah.

59:23.519 --> 59:26.120
I got a undesirable discharge
in there

59:26.256 --> 59:28.256
because I was always salty.

59:28.391 --> 59:30.294
I wanted to be in the army.

59:30.429 --> 59:33.737
I always wanted
go over there to Vietnam.

59:36.170 --> 59:39.271
I went to the draft board
to get in.

59:39.407 --> 59:43.874
They had this big party
at the Seaway there then,

59:44.010 --> 59:45.339
where I went the night before.

59:45.474 --> 59:49.645
And get home about four,
you know.

59:51.048 --> 59:52.757
My ma comes home.

59:53.493 --> 59:55.256
"You ain't goin' yet?"

59:57.420 --> 59:58.786
"You ain't goin' yet?"

01:00:00.023 --> 01:00:02.063
My alarm clock's ringin',
I'm still conked out,

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:03.798
and my fuckin' beard's
full of wine,

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.602
- and, you know...

01:00:05.738 --> 01:00:07.838
...and my ma,
she takes me in a taxicab,

01:00:07.973 --> 01:00:10.634
she drives me over there,
and she throws me in there.

01:00:12.273 --> 01:00:15.438
They, uh, they go from
station to station,

01:00:15.573 --> 01:00:19.315
and you sit there,
and I keep fallin' asleep.

01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:23.521
Well, hey, I passed.

01:00:23.657 --> 01:00:24.953
I passed
all the fuckin' tests, man.

01:00:26.453 --> 01:00:28.625
And the guy says, "Hey,
you flunked your physical."

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.429
I said, "What the fuck?
What, my ears?

01:00:32.565 --> 01:00:34.790
I couldn't hear or what?"

01:00:34.926 --> 01:00:36.458
He said, uh,

01:00:36.594 --> 01:00:38.794
"No, your, uh, your
psychiatrist flunked you."

01:00:40.598 --> 01:00:42.273
That doctor's a fuckin' genius.

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:44.299
Yeah, I smell like

01:00:44.434 --> 01:00:46.709
a fuckin' distillery, wined up,

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:49.211
but I give him good answers,
you know.

01:00:49.347 --> 01:00:51.976
So he says,

01:00:52.111 --> 01:00:53.509
"You passed everything, except,"

01:00:53.645 --> 01:00:57.986
he says, "you are
an undesirable character.

01:01:00.558 --> 01:01:02.353
We don't want you."

01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:06.059
I says, "I wanna go," you know?

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.191
And I cussed that fucker out
that told me that.

01:01:08.326 --> 01:01:09.893
I say,
"You goddamn motherfucking

01:01:10.028 --> 01:01:12.231
bastard cocksucker."

01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:17.999
I walked outta there.

01:01:18.135 --> 01:01:20.536
I was crying, man.

01:01:21.379 --> 01:01:23.276
I wanted to go.

01:01:24.412 --> 01:01:26.441
There's pinkos burnin'
their draft cards,

01:01:26.577 --> 01:01:28.043
they that wanna go,
they won't take.

01:01:28.179 --> 01:01:30.579
Boy, that pissed me off.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.731
It means a lot,
you comin' out here

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.231
all banged up like that,
you know?

01:01:47.035 --> 01:01:49.004
I've been thinkin', uh...

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.633
I can't run this club forever.

01:01:51.769 --> 01:01:54.972
You know, I'm gonna have
to find somebody, uh...

01:01:55.107 --> 01:01:57.045
to take it over, you know.

01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:01.447
What about Brucie, huh?

01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:02.745
Brucie.

01:02:02.881 --> 01:02:04.416
Oh...

01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:05.954
Yeah, you know, I love Brucie
like a brother, you know?

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.957
But it ain't,
it ain't Brucie, no.

01:02:09.094 --> 01:02:11.627
Brucie'll get eaten alive
by these guys.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:14.260
It gotta be somebody that, uh...

01:02:16.226 --> 01:02:18.066
...that they respect.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.398
It's gotta be somebody

01:02:20.533 --> 01:02:22.664
that ain't gonna take
no shit off of 'em.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:29.473
It's you.

01:02:33.582 --> 01:02:35.017
Come on.

01:02:45.088 --> 01:02:46.393
Look.

01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:49.298
I built this club
outta nothin', all right?

01:02:49.434 --> 01:02:50.801
I built it.

01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:52.326
I put more
into this fuckin' club

01:02:52.462 --> 01:02:53.765
than my own family, all right?

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:54.872
This is my family.

01:02:56.274 --> 01:02:58.209
I don't know how many
fuckin' chapters we got now.

01:02:58.344 --> 01:03:00.475
I know we got...

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.674
new guys.

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:03.043
We got young guys.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.809
I don't even know
some of them, but...

01:03:05.944 --> 01:03:08.249
the guys I do know, you know,
they ain't gonna follow nobody

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:11.515
except somebody who can
hold their own, you know?

01:03:13.117 --> 01:03:14.919
Look at me.

01:03:15.054 --> 01:03:17.358
I'm all fucked up.

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:18.762
Hmm.

01:03:18.898 --> 01:03:19.993
I can't even
pay the fuckin' dues.

01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:21.861
Yeah, well, fuck the dues.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.841
You're a grown-up, man.

01:03:31.204 --> 01:03:33.674
You got a house. You got a job.

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:35.173
I don't want that.

01:03:35.308 --> 01:03:37.244
I don't care about none of that.

01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:43.286
Yeah, you know.

01:03:43.421 --> 01:03:45.115
See...

01:03:45.251 --> 01:03:47.155
that's why it's you.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.685
Huh?

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:53.194
You are who all these guys here,

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.691
they're all, they're all
trying to be.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.562
You see?

01:04:02.332 --> 01:04:04.370
- Johnny...
- What?

01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:09.111
It's yours.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.182
Hmm.

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:27.096
Hey, you know...

01:04:28.099 --> 01:04:30.902
Just think it over, you know.

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.217
Sonny, you, uh...

01:04:50.483 --> 01:04:52.021
...y-you ride
in California, right?

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:54.453
- Your club's out there?
-Mm-hmm.

01:04:55.994 --> 01:04:57.929
So why the hell
are you way out here?

01:05:00.456 --> 01:05:02.131
I came here for him.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.796
He didn't turn in his colors.

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:09.633
We heard he was ridin'
with another club.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.077
So they brought me out here
to fuck him up.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.445
So, are-are you...

01:05:20.213 --> 01:05:22.745
Are you gonna fuck him up?

01:05:27.183 --> 01:05:28.249
Nah.

01:05:28.384 --> 01:05:29.984
I like you guys.

01:05:30.987 --> 01:05:33.459
I'm hopin' to trip with you
for awhile.

01:05:47.913 --> 01:05:49.673
The fuck happened here?

01:05:51.383 --> 01:05:55.817
Well, I-I think this-this
Funny Sonny just, uh...

01:05:55.953 --> 01:05:57.277
just made Cal shit his pants.

01:06:01.517 --> 01:06:02.823
Look at his face.

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.057
Fuck, man.

01:06:07.193 --> 01:06:09.132
Goddamn. Fuck.

01:06:10.102 --> 01:06:12.866
I smell something,
is all I'm saying.

01:06:17.403 --> 01:06:18.701
I mean, he's... It's...

01:06:18.837 --> 01:06:20.610
You know, I understand.
He's a scary guy.

01:06:31.814 --> 01:06:33.253
<i>I mean, the only thing is</i>

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:35.653
<i>I thought I could change him,
you know?</i>

01:06:36.488 --> 01:06:38.722
- Oh, jeez.

01:06:38.858 --> 01:06:41.659
I mean, every woman thinks
that she can change a guy,

01:06:41.794 --> 01:06:44.197
not to her own ways,
but to be different, you know?

01:06:44.332 --> 01:06:46.969
Not to be different,
but to be...

01:06:47.105 --> 01:06:49.533
I don't know, like, he's wild.

01:06:49.669 --> 01:06:52.001
I thought
he'd get over that, but...

01:06:52.136 --> 01:06:53.473
no.

01:06:54.675 --> 01:06:57.179
But Benny, he always
talks about leavin'.

01:06:57.315 --> 01:06:59.412
You know, sometimes
I wish he would, you know?

01:06:59.547 --> 01:07:01.050
'Cause every time
he gets into trouble,

01:07:01.186 --> 01:07:02.719
the first thing
he'll say to me is,

01:07:02.855 --> 01:07:04.679
"Well, I'm gonna leave."

01:07:04.815 --> 01:07:06.355
And I think
he just says this to me

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:08.952
so I say to him, you know,
"Don't go, don't go."

01:07:09.088 --> 01:07:11.589
But it's gettin' to where
if he'd just go,

01:07:11.725 --> 01:07:13.623
not tell me about it,
but just pick up and go,

01:07:13.758 --> 01:07:15.292
it doesn't hurt so bad,
you know?

01:07:15.428 --> 01:07:18.666
I mean, I've got feelings.

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:21.369
'Cause Benny has no feelings.
I don't know where he gets it.

01:07:22.801 --> 01:07:25.038
From what I hear,
even when his father died,

01:07:25.173 --> 01:07:26.710
he showed no feelings.

01:07:26.846 --> 01:07:28.044
Said he's better off dead.

01:07:28.179 --> 01:07:29.775
I mean, Benny thinks
that when you die,

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:31.540
you're better off than
when you're living, you know?

01:07:31.675 --> 01:07:33.111
Like when his dad died, he said,

01:07:33.247 --> 01:07:34.576
"It's just as well.

01:07:34.711 --> 01:07:36.282
He's better off that way."

01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:37.821
You know,
when Brucie got killed,

01:07:37.956 --> 01:07:39.882
"He's better off that way."

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:42.390
No feelings.

01:07:43.858 --> 01:07:45.755
Brucie, I mean, I-I think
ever since Brucie died,

01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:47.289
things with the club
have changed, you know?

01:07:47.424 --> 01:07:48.365
Don't you?

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.365
Hmm.

01:07:55.533 --> 01:07:57.141
I mean, I miss Brucie.

01:08:07.786 --> 01:08:09.016
Nothin'.

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:11.155
Just pow. That's it.

01:08:12.456 --> 01:08:14.923
I mean,
that's how it is, you know.

01:08:15.059 --> 01:08:16.721
There's always that one.

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:19.293
You know, there's always
that one that gets you.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.656
It's the one that comes out,

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:22.065
that one that comes
out of nowhere.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.294
That's the one
that will get you.

01:08:23.429 --> 01:08:24.427
That's it.

01:08:24.563 --> 01:08:26.335
One that comes outta nowhere.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.408
Hey, Johnny.

01:08:34.206 --> 01:08:35.536
Yeah.

01:08:35.671 --> 01:08:37.445
We just got a call.

01:08:38.617 --> 01:08:40.107
What?

01:08:40.843 --> 01:08:42.776
It's the funeral home.

01:08:42.912 --> 01:08:44.353
They won't take the flowers.

01:08:45.657 --> 01:08:47.114
What?

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:48.882
They won't take the flowers
you sent over there.

01:08:49.018 --> 01:08:51.195
Says the family don't want 'em.

01:08:56.793 --> 01:08:58.964
Well, fuck it. Send them anyway.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.998
You know, they can eat 'em
if they don't wanna take 'em.

01:09:01.134 --> 01:09:02.833
Okay.

01:09:05.336 --> 01:09:06.637
Wait.

01:09:06.773 --> 01:09:09.177
Get the guys together,
all right?

01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:12.106

You guys remember Teddy Singer?

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.283
Yeah.

01:10:26.419 --> 01:10:27.687
Yeah.

01:10:28.685 --> 01:10:31.118
And Teddy Singer died

01:10:31.254 --> 01:10:33.293
on the way back
from, uh, the blessing

01:10:33.428 --> 01:10:35.197
on Saint Christopher's Day.

01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:38.263
Yeah, he swerved
and hit a parked car

01:10:38.398 --> 01:10:39.402
near the rock quarry.

01:10:40.938 --> 01:10:42.405
Good guy.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.569
Yeah, he used to,
used to ride that, uh,

01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:48.672
beautiful Knucklehead, the...

01:10:48.807 --> 01:10:51.271
All chrome. Nothin' but chrome.

01:10:51.406 --> 01:10:53.583
His dad made
s-special things for 'em.

01:10:53.718 --> 01:10:57.653
You know, because his dad was
a... was a tool and diemaker.

01:10:57.789 --> 01:10:59.114
Yeah.

01:11:01.422 --> 01:11:02.654
After-after Teddy died,

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:05.525
I, um, I did offer his dad
to buy the bike

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.695
because, you know,
it's beautiful.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.135
I offered him good money, too,
you know?

01:11:12.271 --> 01:11:14.602
But he wouldn't, he wouldn't...

01:11:16.207 --> 01:11:17.737
...he wouldn't sell it.

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:22.612
You see?

01:11:24.478 --> 01:11:26.279
He wouldn't sell it.

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:28.682
He didn't even ride it.

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:31.487
He kept the bike.

01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:34.523
In his basement.

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:37.427
Right?

01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:41.695
You understand?

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.402
Yeah?

01:11:49.137 --> 01:11:50.341
Anyway.

01:12:03.011 --> 01:12:05.246
Just fuck it. Fuck it.

01:12:28.546 --> 01:12:29.913
You know,
that's how I wanna die.

01:12:30.048 --> 01:12:32.346
Absa-fuckin-lutely.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:35.243
And my mother, she says to me...

01:12:35.378 --> 01:12:36.912
She says,
"Well, you've had wrecks.

01:12:37.047 --> 01:12:39.355
"I mean, you've seen people die,

01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:40.816
"seen both your cousins
die on bikes.

01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:43.317
You're gonna kill yourself."

01:12:43.452 --> 01:12:46.462
But that's... that's the way
I wanna die.

01:12:46.598 --> 01:12:49.361
And when I die,
I wanna die on a bike.

01:12:49.496 --> 01:12:50.563
Shut the fuck up.

01:12:50.698 --> 01:12:51.926
-There's no...
- Shut...

01:12:52.062 --> 01:12:53.868
- the fuck up...
-What?

01:12:54.004 --> 01:12:55.296
Johnny.

01:12:56.835 --> 01:12:58.532
Hey, they say that, uh...

01:12:58.668 --> 01:13:01.104
they say that you're the one
to talk to about joinin' up.

01:13:08.854 --> 01:13:10.250
Oh, no.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.219
No, we don't, uh...

01:13:12.355 --> 01:13:13.454
we don't take kids.

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:15.388
But I ain't a kid. I'm 20.

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:16.717
Come on. Get out of here.

01:13:16.853 --> 01:13:18.385
All right? Just...

01:13:19.321 --> 01:13:20.460
Will you just come
look at our bikes?

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:21.590
We chopped 'em ourselves.

01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:23.731
Okay.

01:13:30.065 --> 01:13:32.608
Come look at our bikes.

01:13:47.955 --> 01:13:50.461
Let's see these pieces of shit.

01:14:00.467 --> 01:14:02.439
Oh, my God.

01:14:02.574 --> 01:14:04.003
- These are pieces of shit.

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:07.843
So we, uh... we scrapped
all the pieces ourselves.

01:14:07.979 --> 01:14:10.542
You know, I mean, we didn't
have nothin', but we did it.

01:14:10.678 --> 01:14:12.681
You know, we did all the work.

01:14:15.812 --> 01:14:17.246
There you go.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.022
Wh-What do you call yourselves?

01:14:20.158 --> 01:14:21.921
The Renegades.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:26.156
We've been ridin'
since we were kids.

01:14:28.734 --> 01:14:31.360
Look, we'll do whatever
we gotta do. All right?

01:14:31.495 --> 01:14:33.795
If you want us to rob someone,
we'll rob 'em.

01:14:33.931 --> 01:14:35.198
You know, if you want us

01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:36.573
to fight someone,
we'll kill 'em.

01:14:37.776 --> 01:14:40.808
All we wanna do, we wanna...
we wanna ride with you.

01:14:42.944 --> 01:14:45.179
You want this pretty bad,
huh, kid?

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.444
Yeah.

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:53.656
I bet if I offered you
to run this whole club,

01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:56.760
you'd take it in a heartbeat,
right?

01:14:56.896 --> 01:14:58.991
What?

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.061
Nothin'.

01:15:04.662 --> 01:15:06.064
Uh...

01:15:08.734 --> 01:15:10.706
Yeah. You're in.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:17.779
But just you.

01:15:20.618 --> 01:15:22.916
You gotta leave
your friends behind.

01:15:31.623 --> 01:15:32.662
Fine.

01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:34.923
Nah.

01:15:35.059 --> 01:15:36.899
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:15:37.035 --> 01:15:38.393
Nuh-uh.

01:15:41.632 --> 01:15:42.705
No.

01:15:43.374 --> 01:15:45.169
Get the fuck outta here.

01:15:46.335 --> 01:15:48.611
What kinda piece of shit
are you?

01:15:48.747 --> 01:15:51.644
What, you leave
your friends behind like that?

01:15:54.282 --> 01:15:56.251
No.

01:15:56.387 --> 01:15:57.786
Get the fuck outta here.

01:15:57.921 --> 01:15:59.656
I don't wanna see you
around here ever again.

01:16:03.022 --> 01:16:04.419
-Johnny!
-Hey!

01:16:04.554 --> 01:16:05.994
-Hey, you...
-Johnny, hey, hey!

01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:13.499
All right,
clean this piece of shit up

01:16:13.634 --> 01:16:15.331
and get outta here.

01:16:18.804 --> 01:16:21.801
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:16:24.573 --> 01:16:26.749
Cocksucker, motherfucker.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.314
<i>But you left.</i>

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:31.049
What?

01:16:31.185 --> 01:16:33.888
You left before
things really got bad.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:37.661
I guess it was '69, so, uh...

01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:40.224
So, yeah,
I was done with school,

01:16:40.359 --> 01:16:42.593
and I just packed
and left for New York.

01:16:44.426 --> 01:16:45.667
That's why I wanted to talk.

01:16:45.803 --> 01:16:48.062
I wanted to know
what happened to the guys.

01:16:48.197 --> 01:16:50.168
What happened to the club.

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:54.543
You know, a year or so after
Brucie died, after you left,

01:16:54.679 --> 01:16:56.277
things with the club
really changed.

01:16:56.412 --> 01:16:58.209
They just got...

01:17:00.013 --> 01:17:01.849
You know, and the club,
it split.

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:03.886
It split between
the old guys and the new guys,

01:17:04.021 --> 01:17:07.053
between the beer drinkers
and the pot smokers.

01:17:08.853 --> 01:17:10.221
And those rules,

01:17:10.356 --> 01:17:12.025
<i>it's just a bunch
of made-up stuff,</i>

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:13.895
<i>but these new guys
really believed 'em.</i>

01:17:14.031 --> 01:17:16.667
<i>It was like it was all written
in stone or something.</i>

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:20.528
There's a guy
used to ride with us.

01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:23.467
Took photos.

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:26.369
He says he's, uh...
he says he's gonna make a book.

01:17:27.312 --> 01:17:28.943
So I says to him...

01:17:30.242 --> 01:17:32.139
"All I ever want
is to be photographed

01:17:32.275 --> 01:17:34.615
dressed up like a barbarian."

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.277
Like a real barbarian, you know?

01:17:36.412 --> 01:17:39.482
With fur and an axe
or some shit.

01:17:44.928 --> 01:17:46.520
I can't really take it anymore.

01:17:46.655 --> 01:17:50.901
So, there I am,
perplexed about what to do.

01:17:51.036 --> 01:17:54.194
This guy seems he's gonna
pull rank on me or something.

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:55.871
And I'm not having it.

01:17:57.576 --> 01:18:00.007
So this guy's hassling me, man.

01:18:00.971 --> 01:18:02.205
Hey, Funny,

01:18:02.341 --> 01:18:04.748
- stop hogging the booze, man.
-Mm.

01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:07.341
So this, I'm like,

01:18:07.476 --> 01:18:09.119
"Listen, man. I'm warning you."

01:18:09.254 --> 01:18:11.019
One step closer,

01:18:11.155 --> 01:18:13.421
and I'm gonna...
I'm gonna give it to him.

01:18:15.053 --> 01:18:16.252
Boy, look at that dress.

01:18:16.387 --> 01:18:18.427
I bet I'd look good
in that dress.

01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:20.797
Yeah. I bet you would, Kathy.

01:18:20.933 --> 01:18:23.064
And when I get salty,
motherfucker...

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.496
yeah, it's like a fucking
old egg sandwich. You know?

01:18:27.631 --> 01:18:29.429
He's lucky I wasn't mad,
you know?

01:18:29.564 --> 01:18:31.170
<i>You got all these new guys,</i>

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.575
<i>you know, half of 'em
coming back from Vietnam.</i>

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:34.207
<i>They're the pot smokers,</i>

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:36.273
<i>and they're different,
these young ones, I mean.</i>

01:18:36.409 --> 01:18:38.240
<i>You know, I mean,
smoking pot, sure. You know?</i>

01:18:38.376 --> 01:18:40.245
<i>But they do other stuff, too.
Drugs.</i>

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.719
<i>You know, like hard stuff,
and they're crazy.</i>

01:18:42.854 --> 01:18:45.448
I got him laid out
on the floor, right?

01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:47.283
And I put this right up
to the back of his head.

01:18:47.419 --> 01:18:49.618
He says,
"Why don't you let me go?"

01:18:49.753 --> 01:18:52.085
I say, "You ain't goin'
nowhere, motherfucker.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.795
"I captured you.

01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:57.031
You go when I say you can go."

01:18:58.903 --> 01:19:01.062
You hear what they did
to Cockroach?

01:19:01.197 --> 01:19:03.067
What'd you say?

01:19:03.203 --> 01:19:04.740
A motorcycle cop.

01:19:04.876 --> 01:19:08.444
I always wanted to be
a motorcycle cop.

01:19:08.579 --> 01:19:10.143
That's why I gotta...

01:19:11.483 --> 01:19:13.113
...give my colors back.

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.313
You say you're quittin'?

01:19:16.914 --> 01:19:17.783
Yeah.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:21.088
But what better job, huh?

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:23.858
I say, what better job is there
than to get paid

01:19:23.994 --> 01:19:26.962
to sit on a Harley-Davidson
all day long?

01:19:28.065 --> 01:19:29.756
I already told her.
She's gotta call a lawyer,

01:19:29.891 --> 01:19:30.963
- you know?
- I don't think she'll do that.

01:19:31.098 --> 01:19:32.292
I told her that last week.
She...

01:19:32.428 --> 01:19:33.903
- Kathy. Here.
-Oh.

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:35.669
Here.

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:37.840
Where'd you get that?

01:19:37.975 --> 01:19:39.170
That girl,
she wants you to have it.

01:19:39.306 --> 01:19:40.910
Sonny, what the heck
is she wearin'?

01:19:41.046 --> 01:19:42.913
She took some fellas upstairs.
She don't need it.

01:19:43.048 --> 01:19:44.670
Don't worry.
They're having a good time.

01:19:44.806 --> 01:19:46.007
She said
she wants you to have it.

01:19:46.142 --> 01:19:48.247
She did, huh?

01:19:49.078 --> 01:19:50.447
Try it on.

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:56.860
Come on!

01:19:57.758 --> 01:19:58.956
Yeah.

01:19:59.092 --> 01:20:00.325
We're like Santa Claus.

01:20:07.032 --> 01:20:08.029
Where are they from?

01:20:08.164 --> 01:20:09.869
Columbus.

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:12.398
All you new fuckin' guys.

01:20:12.534 --> 01:20:13.910
Yeah, I can't keep up.

01:20:15.306 --> 01:20:18.343
I gotta... I gotta take a piss.

01:20:43.007 --> 01:20:45.302
- Fuck. Fuck!
- You wanna quit, motherfucker?

01:20:45.438 --> 01:20:47.472
You wanna quit,
you motherfucker?

01:20:51.507 --> 01:20:53.675
-Yeah.
-Whoo.

01:20:56.819 --> 01:20:58.218
It's real pretty.

01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:00.715
You look good, Kathy.

01:21:02.286 --> 01:21:04.455
It's good.

01:21:05.256 --> 01:21:06.424
Benny, come 'ere.

01:21:30.578 --> 01:21:32.318
What's goin' on?

01:21:37.323 --> 01:21:39.254
Somebody fucked him up good.

01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:40.755
- You see who did it?
- Nah.

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:42.195
All right, let's get him
loaded in the car.

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:44.458
You two, you need
to take him to a hospital.

01:21:44.593 --> 01:21:45.701
-Come on.
- Okay.

01:21:45.836 --> 01:21:47.702
Come on. Up you get.

01:21:47.838 --> 01:21:50.864
♪ A thousand lights ♪

01:21:52.005 --> 01:21:53.801
♪ Look at you ♪

01:21:55.604 --> 01:21:58.740
♪ A thousand lights ♪

01:21:59.409 --> 01:22:01.578
♪ Look at you... ♪

01:22:03.581 --> 01:22:05.918
- Where you goin'?
- Let go.

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:07.150
- Let go.
- I'm sorry.

01:22:07.286 --> 01:22:08.251
- Stop!
- Look what we got.

01:22:08.386 --> 01:22:09.451
- Don't worry.
- Come on.

01:22:09.586 --> 01:22:10.994
- We'll take care of you.
- Stop!

01:22:11.129 --> 01:22:12.287
- We're gonna take care of you.
-Stop it!

01:22:12.423 --> 01:22:15.157
- No! No!

01:22:15.292 --> 01:22:17.000
- We got you.
- No.

01:22:17.929 --> 01:22:19.261
No!

01:22:19.396 --> 01:22:21.763
- Come on.
- No.

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.265
Goddamn, girl.

01:22:24.401 --> 01:22:25.967
Benny! Benny!

01:22:26.103 --> 01:22:27.337
No! No.

01:22:27.473 --> 01:22:29.705
- Hey, hey, hey!
-No!

01:22:31.514 --> 01:22:32.812
No.

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.146
Benny! Benny, no! No.

01:22:34.281 --> 01:22:35.919
The fuck you doin'?

01:22:36.054 --> 01:22:37.750
All right, we're just
getting our wings.

01:22:40.415 --> 01:22:41.849
Come on, man.

01:22:41.985 --> 01:22:43.649
They said the girl in
the red dress was ready to go.

01:22:43.785 --> 01:22:45.289
We're just gettin' ours.

01:22:45.425 --> 01:22:47.327
They said the girl
in the red dress.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.694
Get the fuck outta here.

01:22:53.171 --> 01:22:55.702
Fuck, man,
fuckin' misunderstanding.

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.337
Fuck outta here.

01:23:03.981 --> 01:23:05.939
Where's Benny?

01:23:08.148 --> 01:23:10.478
Um, well, he's not...

01:23:10.614 --> 01:23:12.814
He's not here. He had to go.

01:23:15.321 --> 01:23:17.720
Yeah.

01:23:18.992 --> 01:23:20.756
You're okay.

01:23:51.689 --> 01:23:54.328
It's short pours. Short.

01:23:55.896 --> 01:23:57.529
Yeah, but, I mean, it's like
they're walking out the back

01:23:57.664 --> 01:24:00.026
- with a bottle a night.

01:24:01.396 --> 01:24:02.864
Johnny.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.906
If liquor keeps walkin',
we're going to...

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:07.236
No, I told 'em.

01:24:07.372 --> 01:24:08.903
I need to talk with you.

01:24:12.077 --> 01:24:13.215
Alone.

01:24:15.414 --> 01:24:17.219
They broke two fuckin' ribs.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:21.124
These fuckin' new guys.

01:24:22.884 --> 01:24:24.622
I think they're crazy, Johnny.

01:24:28.465 --> 01:24:31.563
I told my old lady
I'd turn in my colors.

01:24:34.531 --> 01:24:36.931
I wanna turn in my colors.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.539
Quit the club.

01:24:43.274 --> 01:24:44.873
I understand.

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:48.211
But, Johnny, these guys,

01:24:48.347 --> 01:24:50.813
the fucking new ones...

01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:56.951
I'm worried when they find out,
they'll fuckin' kill me.

01:24:59.631 --> 01:25:00.823
I need help.

01:25:04.029 --> 01:25:05.432
Hmm.

01:25:09.302 --> 01:25:10.965
I'll take care of ya.

01:25:31.522 --> 01:25:33.119
You got a pistol, right?

01:25:36.634 --> 01:25:38.030
Yeah.

01:25:38.165 --> 01:25:40.126
Bring it by tonight.

01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:44.807
What are we gonna do?

01:25:44.942 --> 01:25:47.034
We gotta go see Cockroach.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.798
Benny?

01:26:09.934 --> 01:26:11.465
- You up here?
- Yeah.

01:26:12.761 --> 01:26:14.237
Whatcha doin'?

01:26:15.839 --> 01:26:17.240
Nothin'.

01:26:20.806 --> 01:26:22.740
Look, I got somethin'
I need to say.

01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:25.213
I gotta be someplace.

01:26:25.349 --> 01:26:28.515
Well, we all got places to be,
you know?

01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:33.916
All right, what is it?

01:26:45.829 --> 01:26:47.769
I can't live like this no more.

01:26:51.036 --> 01:26:53.342
And I ain't gonna live
like this no more.

01:26:57.012 --> 01:26:59.744
Well, you weren't there, Benny.
You didn't see it, you know?

01:26:59.879 --> 01:27:01.444
Like, I-I don't know
what I would've done

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:02.846
if they got me up those stairs

01:27:02.981 --> 01:27:04.085
and into that bedroom.
You know, I'm...

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.751
Johnny said he took care of it.

01:27:05.886 --> 01:27:07.355
- He said nothin' happened.
- But that's not true.

01:27:07.491 --> 01:27:09.551
You weren't there.
You didn't see it.

01:27:09.687 --> 01:27:10.859
I mean, you weren't there.

01:27:10.995 --> 01:27:13.092
I know. I-I'm sorry.

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:15.023
You weren't there!

01:27:17.534 --> 01:27:18.891
If they'da got me
up those stairs,

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:20.333
I think I woulda taken your gun,

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:21.663
and I woulda popped
my brains out.

01:27:21.798 --> 01:27:23.571
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

01:27:23.707 --> 01:27:25.934
You know, I-I know
I'm always sayin' that

01:27:26.069 --> 01:27:27.640
people who commit suicide,
they must be nuts.

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:30.940
Well, you know, I think
this time I would go nuts.

01:27:33.113 --> 01:27:35.281
Well, who'd even want you
after a thing like that?

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.320
Who'd even wanna look at you?

01:27:40.123 --> 01:27:41.755
What do you want me to do?

01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:45.119
I want you to quit ridin'.
I want you to quit the club.

01:27:46.788 --> 01:27:48.298
Don't ask that.

01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:53.830
Yeah, I was thinkin' we'd go
someplace, you know? You...

01:27:53.965 --> 01:27:55.796
I mean, you said
you had a cousin in Florida

01:27:55.931 --> 01:27:57.673
with a garage you could work at.

01:27:57.808 --> 01:28:00.268
Let's go there, you know.
Let's just go someplace, Benny.

01:28:03.814 --> 01:28:05.315
Benny.

01:28:10.216 --> 01:28:11.084
Benny!

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.850
- What?

01:28:15.654 --> 01:28:18.251
What do you think this is? Hmm?

01:28:20.959 --> 01:28:23.465
What did you ever think
this was gonna be?

01:28:38.816 --> 01:28:40.240
Benny.

01:28:43.021 --> 01:28:44.354
I gotta go meet Johnny.

01:29:17.884 --> 01:29:20.346
Don't do nothin'.
Just follow me in.

01:30:00.865 --> 01:30:02.289
You ready?

01:30:05.201 --> 01:30:06.964
Give me the pistol.

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:12.140
Fuck! Fuck!

01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:21.275
You let it bleed.

01:30:23.547 --> 01:30:25.312
Go now.

01:30:26.418 --> 01:30:27.688
Stay gone.

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:36.026
Come on.

01:31:11.565 --> 01:31:13.602
The fuck was all that for?

01:31:16.831 --> 01:31:18.101
That...

01:31:19.335 --> 01:31:22.105
that was takin' care
of Cockroach.

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.014
Like you took care of Kathy?

01:31:36.019 --> 01:31:38.693
Is that what this club is now?

01:31:42.695 --> 01:31:44.424
Is that who we are now?

01:31:49.799 --> 01:31:51.541
That's it.

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:10.318
Benny. Benny.

01:32:12.524 --> 01:32:13.893
Um...

01:32:19.059 --> 01:32:20.834
These new guys.

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.771
These, uh...

01:32:25.904 --> 01:32:28.270
These young guys, they...

01:32:33.044 --> 01:32:34.650
Don't none of 'em listen.

01:32:37.888 --> 01:32:41.591
I, uh... I can't,
I can't run this club no more.

01:32:47.922 --> 01:32:48.994
I n...

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.636
I need ya.

01:33:00.936 --> 01:33:02.205
You know...

01:33:04.406 --> 01:33:06.473
I don't ask nobody for nothin'.

01:33:09.577 --> 01:33:11.753
And I don't want nothin'
from nobody.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.153
It's not me.

01:33:16.953 --> 01:33:19.552
Never gonna be me.

01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:30.233
Mm.

01:33:56.963 --> 01:33:58.323
<i>You know, Benny always</i>

01:33:58.459 --> 01:34:00.329
<i>talked about leavin'.</i>

01:34:01.835 --> 01:34:03.706
<i>And then he was gone.</i>

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:07.204
It's like Funny Sonny
says to me.

01:34:07.339 --> 01:34:09.339
He says, "Kathy,
I'm gonna tell you something."

01:34:09.474 --> 01:34:11.342
He says, "Once you go out
with a guy from the Vandals,"

01:34:11.478 --> 01:34:15.049
he says, "you'll never go back
to any other guy." You know?

01:34:15.184 --> 01:34:17.486
And I think this is true,
'cause after a while,

01:34:17.621 --> 01:34:19.184
you get just like them.
You know?

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.651
You start thinkin' like them
and actin' like them.

01:34:21.786 --> 01:34:23.520
It changes you.

01:34:23.655 --> 01:34:25.489
And Benny was gone more than
a year, 'cause that was '71.

01:34:25.624 --> 01:34:28.357
You know, that's when some kid
showed up to challenge Johnny.

01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:32.698
<i>I'd never heard of him.</i>

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:34.495
<i>You know, it was just some kid.</i>

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:39.269
Hey.

01:34:51.917 --> 01:34:53.613
I'm a Vandal now.

01:34:54.258 --> 01:34:55.717
What chapter?

01:34:55.852 --> 01:34:57.727
Milwaukee.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:01.422
All my guys been talkin'.

01:35:01.557 --> 01:35:03.562
We're done with you
runnin' things.

01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:08.837
I'm here to challenge you.

01:35:12.408 --> 01:35:14.040
Fists or knives?

01:35:15.575 --> 01:35:17.208
Knives.

01:35:19.083 --> 01:35:20.508
Hmm.

01:35:23.917 --> 01:35:25.612
All right. There's a...

01:35:27.581 --> 01:35:30.892
There's a parking lot on Fuller.

01:35:31.593 --> 01:35:32.960
Near the lake.

01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:35.292
Tomorrow night.

01:35:36.596 --> 01:35:37.624
All right.

01:36:04.319 --> 01:36:05.920
Any ideas?

01:36:06.055 --> 01:36:08.589
A few. A few.

01:36:08.725 --> 01:36:11.592
But I wanna take a look
at the test before I commit.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:14.560
How was your evening?

01:36:14.696 --> 01:36:17.598
- Where are the girls?
- Out with friends.

01:36:19.137 --> 01:36:20.607
All right, I gotta head out.

01:36:20.743 --> 01:36:22.242
You comin' back tonight?

01:36:22.378 --> 01:36:23.612
Yeah.

01:36:23.748 --> 01:36:25.437
You grab some eggs
on your way home?

01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:27.280
I don't wanna get out again.

01:36:27.415 --> 01:36:29.976
Well, I apologize
for the way she acted, Steve.

01:36:30.112 --> 01:36:31.281
Always late.

01:36:31.417 --> 01:36:32.654
Kay was against
our coming out.

01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:33.947
- Yeah.
-She was very content.

01:36:36.158 --> 01:36:37.523
She couldn't understand
why I wasn't.

01:37:28.874 --> 01:37:30.473
Hey! Johnny.

01:37:34.209 --> 01:37:35.808
Hey, Kathy.

01:37:48.831 --> 01:37:50.625
Benny ever come back around?

01:37:53.765 --> 01:37:54.860
No.

01:37:56.998 --> 01:38:00.239
No, if he had, I figured
you woulda seen him before me.

01:38:00.937 --> 01:38:02.274
Nah.

01:38:04.248 --> 01:38:08.577
Yeah, last I heard, he rode
to, uh, Indiana with some guys.

01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:12.119
That sounds right.

01:38:15.053 --> 01:38:16.354
What do you need?

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:21.964
Nothin'.

01:38:29.666 --> 01:38:31.765
Well, I guess
neither of us got him.

01:38:37.074 --> 01:38:38.574
I guess not.

01:38:50.153 --> 01:38:51.620
You know...

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.426
You can give everything you got
to a thing.

01:38:58.561 --> 01:39:01.366
Yeah, you can give it
all you got.

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:06.140
And it's still just gonna do
what it's gonna do.

01:39:09.137 --> 01:39:10.540
Mm.

01:39:12.445 --> 01:39:15.644
What, you mean
like my marriages?

01:39:25.656 --> 01:39:27.788
Come on, Johnny.
What do you need?

01:39:34.165 --> 01:39:35.796
I already said it.

01:39:40.401 --> 01:39:41.802
Nothin'.

01:39:51.349 --> 01:39:53.418
Hey, take it easy, Kathy.

01:39:57.892 --> 01:39:59.527
You, too, Johnny.

01:40:13.834 --> 01:40:15.173
<i>It was late October,</i>

01:40:15.308 --> 01:40:17.211
<i>so it was already gettin' cold.</i>

01:40:18.446 --> 01:40:19.873
<i>From what I hear,
some of the old Vandals</i>

01:40:20.008 --> 01:40:22.511
<i>- didn't even take their bikes.</i>

01:40:22.646 --> 01:40:24.647
<i>They just sat in their cars
to watch.</i>

01:40:25.449 --> 01:40:26.512
The Huber Law.

01:40:26.648 --> 01:40:28.486
What? What is that, German?

01:40:29.555 --> 01:40:30.989
Nah, Huber Law
is when you go to work

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.423
and you go to jail at night.

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:34.589
That's-that's what I'm sayin'.

01:40:34.725 --> 01:40:36.191
They're teachin' 'em a trade.

01:40:36.326 --> 01:40:37.523
All these flunkies.

01:40:58.254 --> 01:41:00.914
All right,
let me take care of this.

01:41:03.587 --> 01:41:05.457
Go get 'em, Johnny.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.433
It's gettin' fuckin' cold
out there.

01:41:31.755 --> 01:41:33.386
How you want it, kid?

01:41:38.694 --> 01:41:40.052
Fuck.

01:41:58.443 --> 01:42:00.479
Well, I heard a guy say later...

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:03.779
a bikerider, he says
that once Johnny got killed,

01:42:03.914 --> 01:42:06.881
that was the end of
the golden age of motorcycles.

01:42:11.524 --> 01:42:12.986
Hey, after that,
this kid took over.

01:42:13.122 --> 01:42:15.197
He turned the Vandals
into a proper gang, you know?

01:42:28.504 --> 01:42:30.641
The fuck we do now?

01:42:34.511 --> 01:42:36.141
Nothin' to do.

01:42:45.953 --> 01:42:47.861
<i>The gang got even bigger.</i>

01:42:53.294 --> 01:42:55.430
<i>I mean, they have chapters
all over the Midwest now,</i>

01:42:55.566 --> 01:42:57.097
<i>even further, you know?</i>

01:42:57.232 --> 01:42:59.570
<i>I heard they started
runnin' drugs down from Canada.</i>

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:02.035
<i>You know, gambling,
prostitution, you name it.</i>

01:43:03.238 --> 01:43:05.038
<i>I mean, I heard
they even murder people.</i>

01:43:10.679 --> 01:43:11.913
You know, and other clubs,

01:43:12.048 --> 01:43:13.514
you know, you think of
Funny Sonny, right?

01:43:13.650 --> 01:43:14.881
Comin' from California.

01:43:15.017 --> 01:43:16.748
That couldn't happen today.
You know?

01:43:16.884 --> 01:43:18.017
I mean, with other clubs,

01:43:18.152 --> 01:43:19.356
they attack each other
on sight now.

01:43:19.491 --> 01:43:21.054
I mean, it's a real shame.

01:43:23.396 --> 01:43:25.361
And what about the other guys?

01:43:25.497 --> 01:43:27.228
What happened to all the guys?

01:43:27.363 --> 01:43:30.267
I mean, well, some of the guys
still ride with 'em, you know.

01:43:30.403 --> 01:43:32.241
Wahoo and Corky, I think.

01:43:33.241 --> 01:43:35.276
They're still Vandals.

01:43:37.013 --> 01:43:40.106
- Fuck you!

01:43:40.241 --> 01:43:42.350
'Cause everybody's melon's
different.

01:43:42.485 --> 01:43:44.380
-<i>You know, Cal died.</i>
- Thinks different.

01:43:44.516 --> 01:43:45.881
<i>Yeah, they said he was, uh...</i>

01:43:46.016 --> 01:43:47.520
<i>he was paintin' houses
in Lakewood.</i>

01:43:47.656 --> 01:43:50.292
<i>He fell off a ladder,
and he broke his neck.</i>

01:43:53.188 --> 01:43:55.659
<i>Somebody told me
Funny Sonny got paid
five bucks</i>

01:43:55.794 --> 01:43:57.762
<i>to sit on his bike
outside the movie theater</i>

01:43:57.897 --> 01:44:00.797
<i>to try to get people in
to watch</i> Easy Rider.

01:44:01.398 --> 01:44:03.235
Whoo!

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:04.598
<i>The whole thing is</i>

01:44:04.734 --> 01:44:05.934
<i>just ridiculous. (chuckles)</i>

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:08.806
<i>Cockroach went back home.</i>

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:11.175
<i>And can you believe this?
He's a motorcycle cop now.</i>

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:13.579
<i>Yeah, of all things.</i>

01:44:15.376 --> 01:44:18.915
<i>And Zipco moved to Texas
to work on a-a shrimp boat.</i>

01:44:19.050 --> 01:44:21.114
<i>That's the last I heard of him.
I don't know.</i>

01:44:25.687 --> 01:44:27.663
And what about Benny?

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:31.122
♪ I love you so ♪

01:44:31.258 --> 01:44:33.730

01:44:39.437 --> 01:44:40.569
Hey, Benny.

01:44:40.704 --> 01:44:42.674
-Mm.
- You hear that?

01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:55.857
They just told me the leader
of the Vandals got killed.

01:44:55.992 --> 01:44:57.491
A guy named Johnny.

01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:02.859
Said some kid just walked up
and shot him in a parking lot.

01:45:05.468 --> 01:45:07.864
Didn't you used to ride
with that guy?

01:45:09.167 --> 01:45:10.570
Mm.

01:45:13.801 --> 01:45:15.509
These fucking kids.

01:47:36.277 --> 01:47:38.652
<i>We moved down here to Florida.</i>

01:47:40.914 --> 01:47:41.985
You know?

01:47:43.819 --> 01:47:45.089
Does he still ride?

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:47.320
No. No.

01:47:48.388 --> 01:47:50.924
No, ever since Johnny died,
you know,

01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:52.996
Benny don't ride no more.

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.669
And, you know, I...

01:47:57.802 --> 01:47:59.838
I don't think he misses it.

01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.078
And things are real good.

01:48:08.881 --> 01:48:10.684
We're real good. We're happy.

01:48:11.719 --> 01:48:13.154
Yeah, Benny works
with his cousin now,

01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:14.881
and things are real good.

01:48:17.957 --> 01:48:19.851
I swear by it. I mean, at cars.

01:48:19.987 --> 01:48:21.662
We're happy.

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:24.498
...stunning cars.

01:48:24.634 --> 01:48:27.258
He comes in,
I'm checking it all out,

01:48:27.394 --> 01:48:29.500
and I go back to him,
and I tell him

01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:31.162
everything that he did wrong.

01:48:31.298 --> 01:48:32.906
How he didn't respect it,

01:48:33.041 --> 01:48:35.137
how he didn't treat it right,
he didn't maintain it.

01:48:35.273 --> 01:48:37.575
Then he starts getting mad.
He starts yelling at me.

01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:38.974
- And so...

01:48:59.001 --> 01:49:03.370
