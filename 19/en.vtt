WEBVTT

02:02.081 --> 02:04.751
John Wick, Excommunicado.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.594
In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.850
I do hope that Mr. Wick
finds his way to safety.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.813
He knew the rules, he broke them.

03:05.144 --> 03:07.154
He killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.519
Do you expect him to make it out?

03:09.607 --> 03:11.357
$14 million bounty on his head.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.362
Every interested party in this city
wants a piece of it.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.276
I'd say the odds are about even.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.223
You think
the hospital's there to help, man?

03:38.094 --> 03:39.304
No way!

03:39.387 --> 03:42.427
They'll kill you
just as soon as they'll make you better.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.234
But I know better, man.
I know better. I know what I'm...

03:54.485 --> 03:56.855
Tick tock, Mr. Wick. Tick tock.

03:57.530 --> 04:01.700
Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick...

04:02.868 --> 04:04.998
No time to dilly-dally, Mr. Wick!

04:19.885 --> 04:21.595
The New York Public Library.

04:21.679 --> 04:22.679
You got it.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.491
Change of plan.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.655
To the Continental.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.712
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.035
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.922
Good dog. Good dog.

05:08.058 --> 05:12.228
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, 20 minutes.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.083
Can I help you?

05:34.168 --> 05:37.338
Russian Folktale. Alexander Afanasyev.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.302
1864.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.853
- Level two.
- Thank you.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.576
"Consider your origins.

06:50.661 --> 06:55.961
You were not made to live as brutes,
but to follow virtue and knowledge."

06:58.836 --> 06:59.836
Dante.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.546
Looking a little run down there, John.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.802
Ernest. I still have time.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.716
It's almost up.
Who's gonna know the difference?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.272
You sure this is what you wanna do?

07:13.350 --> 07:15.100
Fourteen million. It's a lot of money.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.225
Not if you can't spend it.

07:53.057 --> 07:54.177
Oh, shit.

08:46.944 --> 08:47.904
Push it back.

09:02.710 --> 09:07.210
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, 10 minutes.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.975
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

09:21.729 --> 09:25.439
No help, no services of any kind.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.995
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

09:41.790 --> 09:42.790
Mr. Wick.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.335
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.089
I know, Doc, please. There's still time.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.591
No. I can't.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.052
I still have five minutes.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.803
Please.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.767
Come on. Come on.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.653
All right, sit there.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.526
All right, let me see. Let me see.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.656
Puncture wound.

10:21.497 --> 10:24.457
Went deep. Nicked the artery.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.293
Here you go.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.379
All right.

10:33.550 --> 10:38.140
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, one minute.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.318
DQC?

10:57.324 --> 10:58.334
DQC?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.908
Yeah. We're halfway there.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.286
- Five seconds.
- Yeah.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.883
John Wick, Excommunicado.

11:06.959 --> 11:10.999
In effect, in five, four...

11:11.630 --> 11:14.010
Three, two...

11:14.466 --> 11:15.876
One.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.648
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.727
I know. Rules.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.481
Rules.

11:36.822 --> 11:40.742
John Wick, 14 million.
Open contract is now in effect.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.246
All services are suspended.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.855
And away we go.

12:40.594 --> 12:44.854
Top shelf. On the right. Yeah. Take four.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.852
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.113
Mr. Wick?

13:01.031 --> 13:03.121
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.697
But you did.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.285
They'll know.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.660
Know what?

13:07.746 --> 13:09.366
I told you where the medicine was.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.601
Where?

13:27.683 --> 13:30.523
Here. Just below my floating rib.
Be sure not to hit my--

13:33.772 --> 13:35.152
Oh, wait!

13:35.649 --> 13:37.399
One may not be enough.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.448
Yeah. All right.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.950
Be sure not to graze my--

13:55.585 --> 13:56.955
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.335
Thanks, Doc.

23:39.752 --> 23:44.342
John Wick. Open contract.
Increase, 15 million.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.141
Where are you going, Jonathan?

23:58.563 --> 23:59.943
We are closed.

25:57.265 --> 25:58.345
Jardani.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.602
Why have you come home?

26:07.024 --> 26:09.034
You present this to me like an answer.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.609
I still have my ticket.

26:13.448 --> 26:16.408
After all the chaos you've caused
for the last few weeks,

26:16.492 --> 26:18.542
you think your ticket is valid?

26:18.995 --> 26:22.915
You forget that the Ruska Roma
is bound by The High Table,

26:22.999 --> 26:25.289
and The High Table stands above all?

26:26.294 --> 26:28.424
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

26:30.006 --> 26:34.796
You honor me
by bringing death to my front door.

26:36.929 --> 26:41.099
Oh, Jardani, what has become of you?

26:59.410 --> 27:01.160
You are bound...

27:01.245 --> 27:03.365
and I am owed.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.547
Rooney, enough!

27:41.536 --> 27:44.206
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

27:44.288 --> 27:48.418
You know, when my pupils first come here,
they wish for one thing.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.921
A life free of suffering.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.627
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

27:53.714 --> 27:55.764
but as you know,

27:56.551 --> 27:57.681
art is pain.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.894
Life is suffering.

28:08.563 --> 28:10.403
Somehow, you managed to get out.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.034
But here you are, back where you began.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.651
All of this, for what?

28:54.275 --> 28:55.315
Pirouette.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.276
Pirouette, pirouette.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.583
Sit.

29:17.340 --> 29:22.090
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.347
The High Table wants your life.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.848
How can you fight the wind?

29:28.976 --> 29:32.396
How can you smash the mountains?
How can you bury the ocean?

29:33.230 --> 29:35.860
How can you escape from the light?

29:35.942 --> 29:40.492
Of course, you can go to the dark.
But they're in the dark, too.

29:43.115 --> 29:48.155
So tell me, Jardani,
what do you really want?

29:50.915 --> 29:51.915
Passage.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.882
Where did you want to go?

29:56.712 --> 29:58.012
Casablanca.

30:00.508 --> 30:03.508
The path to paradise begins in hell.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.021
So be it.

30:10.518 --> 30:13.978
You hand me your ticket, I will tear it.

30:15.398 --> 30:17.648
If that's what you really desire.

30:57.023 --> 31:00.483
With this, Jardani, your ticket is torn.

31:10.119 --> 31:12.289
You can never come home again.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.833
Take him to the lifeboat.

31:17.752 --> 31:18.842
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

31:21.672 --> 31:23.472
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

31:54.538 --> 31:57.628
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

32:16.018 --> 32:20.608
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

32:22.316 --> 32:23.396
Very well, sir.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.662
The manager is in the lounge.

32:33.577 --> 32:36.497
I presume you're here
to discuss John Wick.

32:37.665 --> 32:39.745
If that's so, we can make this short.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.552
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.009
And that's the all of it.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.378
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.586
Oh, yes.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.722
And I haven't got the slightest idea
where he is--

32:51.804 --> 32:54.934
You're mistaken.
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.385
I'm here because
Mr. Wick broke the rules in this hotel.

32:58.185 --> 33:01.145
The blood was spilt on the grounds
of the Continental, was it not?

33:01.230 --> 33:02.360
Oh, yes.

33:02.439 --> 33:06.609
As a matter of fact, the body gets colder
within these very walls.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.533
I'd like to see it.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.807
Santino D'Antonio.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.847
A newly instated member of The High Table,

33:41.937 --> 33:45.857
slain by Mr. Wick while seeking sanctuary
in the Continental.

33:50.154 --> 33:52.744
With a .45 ACP, it appears.

33:53.908 --> 33:56.828
I had no control over Mr. Wick's actions.

33:56.911 --> 33:59.461
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

34:00.539 --> 34:01.709
Yes.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.790
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.916
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

34:07.171 --> 34:09.511
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

34:09.590 --> 34:11.430
you stood by and let him walk away

34:11.508 --> 34:13.968
after he shot Santino D'Antonio
in front of you.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.013
I made him Excommunicado.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.926
But not before
you gave him an hour to escape.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.556
He broke the rules in my hotel.

34:20.643 --> 34:24.653
This is exactly the problem: your hotel.
Where is your fealty?

34:25.689 --> 34:27.819
I've been of service for over 40 years.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.650
Under The Table. Serving The Table.
Everything is under The Table.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.777
I understand that you have your loyalties,
but this cannot be overlooked.

34:34.865 --> 34:38.115
Let me be clear. I am here to adjudge you.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.077
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

34:41.872 --> 34:42.962
Excuse me?

34:43.040 --> 34:45.790
At such time,
your successor will be named.

34:47.544 --> 34:49.134
There are rules,

34:49.213 --> 34:50.923
they are the only things
that separate us--

34:51.006 --> 34:52.086
From the animals.

34:52.174 --> 34:54.644
Yes. You have seven days.

34:59.014 --> 35:02.024
In the meantime, if you need
any assistance with your transition,

35:02.101 --> 35:04.141
you may look for me in room 217.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.860
Enjoy your stay at the Continental.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.160
There's an Adjudicator here to see you.

35:37.553 --> 35:40.393
Welcome to my Mission Control.

35:40.973 --> 35:44.313
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.483
From whence I control
the word on the street,

35:46.562 --> 35:47.732
the way of the world.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.477
With pigeons.

35:49.565 --> 35:53.105
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

35:54.695 --> 35:58.065
No IP addresses. No digital footprint.

35:58.657 --> 36:02.197
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

36:02.286 --> 36:03.996
Can you get disease from it?

36:05.122 --> 36:06.872
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

36:08.417 --> 36:09.627
What the hell do you want?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.586
I wanted to see where it didn't happen.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.341
Where what didn't happen?

36:14.423 --> 36:16.093
Where you didn't kill John Wick.

36:17.134 --> 36:18.644
I've always been under the impression

36:18.719 --> 36:21.429
that contracts
and executing them was optional.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.313
I have no problem with John Wick.

36:29.772 --> 36:33.282
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

36:33.359 --> 36:36.649
knowing that he intended to use it
to stand against The Table. Yes?

36:41.241 --> 36:43.741
This Kimber 1911, to be exact.

36:51.502 --> 36:55.262
You gave John Wick seven bullets,
The High Table is giving you seven days.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.181
Seven days for what, exactly?

36:58.258 --> 37:01.508
To settle your affairs
and find a new home for your birds.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.429
In seven days, you abdicate your throne.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.244
Oh, my dear.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.990
Tell me, do you know
what the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

37:21.073 --> 37:22.913
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

37:23.659 --> 37:26.949
No, there will be no replacement for me
on the throne.

37:27.037 --> 37:29.497
Because I am the throne, baby.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.461
I am the Bowery!

37:33.127 --> 37:36.797
I am all that you deign not to look at
when you walk down the street at night.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.510
The Bowery is mine. Mine alone.

37:41.760 --> 37:46.220
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you exist outside the rules, no men do.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.604
You have seven days.

39:28.825 --> 39:29.985
Enough!

39:35.791 --> 39:38.501
I'm afraid our friend here is off limits.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.045
But he's Excommunicado.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.173
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

39:45.801 --> 39:49.681
Mr. Jonathan,
would you be so kind as to come with me?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.410
Welcome to Casablanca, Mr. Wick.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.412
Thanks.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.498
Mr. Jonathan, it has been a long time

40:22.588 --> 40:25.088
since our fine city
has been graced with your presence.

40:25.716 --> 40:26.926
I need to talk to--

40:27.009 --> 40:28.969
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar, she's expecting you.

40:36.476 --> 40:39.976
My, my,
welcome to the Moroccan Continental.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.823
I hope you'll find it to your taste.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.935
Right this way.

40:45.027 --> 40:47.447
Ms. Al-Azwar, she waits for no man.

40:52.075 --> 40:56.495
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan. Best of luck.

41:31.573 --> 41:33.453
You a dog person, John?

41:34.534 --> 41:35.544
Sofia?

41:41.291 --> 41:44.501
Sofia, you can't kill
the bearer of your marker.

41:45.212 --> 41:47.842
I didn't kill you. I just shot you.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.344
Nice suit.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.716
Good to see you, too.

41:54.805 --> 41:56.965
I should shoot you in the head right now.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.137
I know.

42:03.772 --> 42:05.402
Don't you do it.

42:07.109 --> 42:08.859
You're Excommunicado, John.

42:09.736 --> 42:14.196
And that marker doesn't mean shit.

42:19.413 --> 42:21.333
This is your blood.

42:22.541 --> 42:23.711
Your bond.

42:24.668 --> 42:29.258
When you needed help, I was there.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.222
Sit.

42:42.352 --> 42:44.192
I was talking to you, John.

42:49.317 --> 42:52.527
You do realize
that I'm management now, right?

42:53.989 --> 42:55.909
I'm not service anymore, John.

42:55.991 --> 42:58.951
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

42:59.619 --> 43:03.999
I'm not asking you to kill anyone.
I just need you to get me to him.

43:04.624 --> 43:07.174
- To who?
- Your old boss.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.594
You want to kill Berrada.

43:10.672 --> 43:12.722
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

43:12.799 --> 43:15.299
What could he possibly give to you?

43:17.929 --> 43:19.259
Guidance.

43:19.347 --> 43:24.137
Look, I made a deal
when I agreed to run this hotel.

43:24.227 --> 43:27.687
And that deal said that I had to follow
the rules of The Table.

43:28.523 --> 43:31.613
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

43:31.693 --> 43:34.573
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

43:35.614 --> 43:39.124
If I make one mistake, one enemy...

43:40.452 --> 43:44.082
maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

43:45.499 --> 43:48.339
And I know what you did, John,
to get her out.

43:49.711 --> 43:53.841
But that's not a chance I can take. Sorry.

43:56.092 --> 43:58.182
Do you wanna know where she is?

43:59.179 --> 44:01.849
No. I don't ever wanna know.

44:02.474 --> 44:05.314
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

44:06.603 --> 44:09.273
A part of me longs for her.

44:10.607 --> 44:14.687
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

44:14.778 --> 44:16.398
just to keep her safe.

44:19.658 --> 44:25.958
Because sometimes,
you have to kill what you love.

44:26.665 --> 44:29.455
That's why I gave you that marker
in the first place.

44:29.543 --> 44:33.343
That's why I'm sitting here right now
and that's why I'm fucked!

44:39.010 --> 44:40.180
Consequences.

44:40.262 --> 44:41.262
Yeah.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.061
Consequences.

44:47.102 --> 44:49.192
I'm just asking you to try.

44:50.313 --> 44:53.613
Either way, you and me, we'll be even.

45:05.078 --> 45:06.118
No.

45:07.789 --> 45:13.039
After this, we are less than even.

45:17.299 --> 45:19.179
We leave in 10 minutes.

46:15.982 --> 46:17.282
How can I help you?

46:29.829 --> 46:31.999
I wasn't expecting The High Table so soon.

46:34.584 --> 46:35.924
There is a task.

46:36.670 --> 46:39.880
It involves someone who broke the rules
and stood against The Table.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.091
John Wick, you mean.

46:44.177 --> 46:45.637
My students have not been idle.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.427
John Wick and all who've helped him.

46:49.516 --> 46:51.426
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

46:51.518 --> 46:54.098
Killed scores of men
this past week alone because of--

46:54.187 --> 46:56.557
A dog, a car.

46:57.691 --> 46:58.821
I'm familiar.

47:02.112 --> 47:03.152
And I'm interested.

47:05.073 --> 47:06.163
Very.

47:12.956 --> 47:15.666
Blowfish. Very fatal.

47:20.588 --> 47:21.758
No soy.

47:30.473 --> 47:33.893
I have served, I will be of service.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.200
Stop!

49:23.419 --> 49:24.419
Out!

49:31.136 --> 49:34.096
The High Table and the Ruska Roma
have an understanding.

49:34.597 --> 49:37.597
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

49:37.684 --> 49:38.774
He had a ticket.

49:38.852 --> 49:41.102
But a ticket does not stand
above The Table.

49:41.187 --> 49:44.017
Your penance will be paid in blood.

49:45.191 --> 49:46.191
Now...

49:48.820 --> 49:53.070
hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

50:01.499 --> 50:06.629
I have served, I will be of service.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.494
We're not going in like the old days.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.030
It's just a conversation.

50:35.533 --> 50:38.913
Nothing's ever just a conversation
with you, John.

50:43.082 --> 50:44.082
Let's go.

51:08.441 --> 51:09.731
Sofia.

51:10.276 --> 51:12.276
Always so nice to see you.

51:13.029 --> 51:16.699
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

51:17.575 --> 51:18.575
Certainly.

51:22.997 --> 51:24.617
Fantastic.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.830
Jonathan Wick.

51:28.253 --> 51:31.383
I had heard
you had made your way to our shores.

51:37.178 --> 51:38.258
Come along now.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.716
I am certain we have much to discuss.

51:45.520 --> 51:49.940
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

51:51.818 --> 51:54.068
Tell me, do you come here to kill me?

51:56.990 --> 51:57.990
No.

52:07.292 --> 52:11.502
Mr. Wick, do you know
where the word "assassin" comes from?

52:13.339 --> 52:16.379
People argue. "Assassin."

52:18.136 --> 52:21.466
Hashasheen, followers of Hassan-i...

52:23.099 --> 52:24.559
Eaters of hashish.

52:27.270 --> 52:28.650
No, thank you.

52:30.315 --> 52:33.645
But others contend
it comes from asasiyyun.

52:33.735 --> 52:37.905
Meaning, "men who are faithful
and who abide by their beliefs."

52:39.782 --> 52:41.032
You see that coin?

52:42.243 --> 52:45.123
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

52:45.997 --> 52:48.917
Next to it, the first marker.

52:49.334 --> 52:51.344
Not easy to track down, believe me.

52:52.003 --> 52:55.973
Now, this coin, of course,
it does not represent monetary value.

52:56.549 --> 52:59.719
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

52:59.802 --> 53:03.222
a social contract
in which you agree to partake.

53:04.265 --> 53:05.555
Order and rules.

53:06.893 --> 53:11.613
You have broken the rules.
The High Table has marked you for death.

53:12.148 --> 53:14.108
Why would I allow you to leave here alive,

53:14.192 --> 53:17.992
when your life has been,
by your own actions, forfeit?

53:23.326 --> 53:24.986
I seek to make amends.

53:26.037 --> 53:27.787
To pay for what I've done.

53:28.414 --> 53:31.924
I seek a meeting
with the one who sits above The Table.

53:36.547 --> 53:39.717
This dog, I do so love it.

53:40.426 --> 53:43.176
Tell me, does it shed a great deal?

53:46.140 --> 53:47.390
Occasionally.

53:48.267 --> 53:50.597
When I leave,
you can tell The Elder I'm coming,

53:51.521 --> 53:52.561
and if he wants me dead--

53:52.647 --> 53:56.027
Then he will see to it
that your bones bleach under the sun.

53:57.443 --> 53:58.493
I see.

53:59.195 --> 54:01.275
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

54:08.871 --> 54:10.581
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

54:11.624 --> 54:13.844
I cannot tell you where to find The Elder.

54:16.879 --> 54:18.259
You fail to understand.

54:18.714 --> 54:22.594
The Elder is not a man you find.
He can only choose to find you.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.217
You wish to speak with him?

54:25.346 --> 54:27.676
Go to the edge of the desert, look up.

54:28.683 --> 54:30.103
Canis Minor,

54:30.184 --> 54:33.234
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

54:33.688 --> 54:37.818
You follow the brightest star,
walk until you are almost dead,

54:38.317 --> 54:40.317
then, keep walking.

54:40.945 --> 54:43.985
When you are on your last breath,
he will find you...

54:45.741 --> 54:47.161
or he will not.

54:48.911 --> 54:50.331
I am grateful.

54:53.124 --> 54:54.334
Thank you, sir.

54:57.044 --> 54:59.054
Perhaps you were not listening before.

55:03.259 --> 55:04.839
The social contract.

55:06.304 --> 55:08.184
The commerce of relationships.

55:09.390 --> 55:12.560
You have received a great gift.
I have hosted your friend.

55:14.020 --> 55:16.020
What do you offer in return?

55:20.193 --> 55:23.033
So soft and yet so fierce.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.741
I love it, this dog.

55:27.366 --> 55:28.696
I will keep it.

55:28.784 --> 55:29.954
Excuse me?

55:30.036 --> 55:34.246
This will be my gift.
This will be how you show me your fealty.

55:34.332 --> 55:35.542
No.

55:35.917 --> 55:37.787
Surely it's the least you can do.

55:37.877 --> 55:39.837
No, you cannot keep my dog.

55:41.047 --> 55:42.047
Very well.

55:43.716 --> 55:44.716
Very well.

55:47.220 --> 55:48.760
Then I will kill it.

55:54.060 --> 55:58.060
I'm sorry, Sofia.
This was for you to learn.

56:06.739 --> 56:07.739
Don't.

56:49.574 --> 56:51.584
Sofia, don't.

56:56.789 --> 56:58.209
He shot my dog.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.207
I get it.

57:03.379 --> 57:05.589
We got to go. Now.

1:03:41.485 --> 1:03:42.565
Here you go.

1:03:47.491 --> 1:03:49.411
You're gonna die, John.

1:03:50.244 --> 1:03:52.374
Whether out here in this desert,

1:03:53.455 --> 1:03:55.415
or somewhere else down the road.

1:03:57.668 --> 1:03:59.088
But you are gonna die.

1:04:14.810 --> 1:04:16.350
Consequences.

1:04:20.482 --> 1:04:21.822
Consequences.

1:04:48.677 --> 1:04:49.797
Better get going.

1:04:59.730 --> 1:05:00.900
Sofia.

1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:43.440
Okay.

1:07:49.191 --> 1:07:50.481
You made your point.

1:07:52.319 --> 1:07:54.149
You have earned my fealty.

1:07:55.405 --> 1:07:58.365
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna shove so much fealty up your ass

1:07:58.450 --> 1:08:00.160
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

1:08:00.244 --> 1:08:02.084
You had your chance.

1:08:02.579 --> 1:08:04.579
Well, since you see it that way,

1:08:05.499 --> 1:08:07.709
I guess it's time I told you

1:08:07.793 --> 1:08:11.593
to climb down off your High Table
and go fuck yourself.

1:08:12.047 --> 1:08:13.087
Duly noted.

1:08:13.715 --> 1:08:19.175
You gave John Wick seven bullets,
your penance will be paid with seven cuts.

1:08:19.263 --> 1:08:21.853
Well, sometimes you got to
cut a motherfucker.

1:08:25.727 --> 1:08:27.227
Avert your eyes, my sweet.

1:08:28.897 --> 1:08:31.777
The king is dead.

1:08:36.863 --> 1:08:38.623
Long live the king.

1:09:32.586 --> 1:09:33.626
Drink.

1:09:35.422 --> 1:09:37.262
Don't worry, your weapon is still there.

1:09:38.508 --> 1:09:39.508
Please drink.

1:09:49.895 --> 1:09:53.225
My son, how have you come to be so lost?

1:09:54.107 --> 1:09:55.317
Not lost.

1:09:56.526 --> 1:09:58.066
Looking for you.

1:09:58.153 --> 1:09:59.953
You think I speak of your location?

1:10:02.157 --> 1:10:05.987
Never seen a man fight so hard
to end up back where he started.

1:10:13.919 --> 1:10:15.549
So tell me, Jonathan.

1:10:16.129 --> 1:10:17.259
Why do you wish to live?

1:10:18.590 --> 1:10:21.510
My wife, Helen.

1:10:24.346 --> 1:10:25.466
To remember her.

1:10:27.307 --> 1:10:28.807
To remember us.

1:10:29.393 --> 1:10:31.983
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

1:10:33.814 --> 1:10:35.904
At least a chance to earn it.

1:10:37.651 --> 1:10:40.701
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

1:10:41.988 --> 1:10:43.948
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:49.370
Complete a task for us,
and your Excommunicado will be reversed.

1:10:49.788 --> 1:10:51.328
The open contract closed,

1:10:51.998 --> 1:10:53.918
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.050
Not free under The Table, but bound to it.

1:10:57.129 --> 1:11:00.089
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

1:11:04.594 --> 1:11:06.054
The choice is yours.

1:11:08.223 --> 1:11:09.523
Die here and now

1:11:10.475 --> 1:11:12.885
or continue to live
and remember through death.

1:11:30.954 --> 1:11:32.914
What must be done?

1:11:32.998 --> 1:11:35.288
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

1:11:36.084 --> 1:11:38.554
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

1:11:39.754 --> 1:11:40.924
What?

1:11:41.006 --> 1:11:42.716
He has forgotten his fealty.

1:11:43.675 --> 1:11:47.295
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado will be lifted

1:11:47.387 --> 1:11:48.757
until you complete your task.

1:11:49.723 --> 1:11:53.063
So if you wish to live,
and if you wish to remember,

1:11:54.394 --> 1:11:56.314
this is the choice you must make.

1:12:13.079 --> 1:12:14.579
I will serve.

1:12:17.167 --> 1:12:19.337
I will be of service.

1:12:20.295 --> 1:12:21.665
Very well, my son.

1:12:22.339 --> 1:12:26.589
Cast aside your weakness
and reaffirm your fealty to The Table.

1:12:33.391 --> 1:12:34.601
Mr. John Wick.

1:13:22.607 --> 1:13:23.857
Thank you.

1:13:25.443 --> 1:13:28.663
I accept this offering and your fealty.

1:13:46.464 --> 1:13:48.384
I wish you good luck on your path.

1:13:49.426 --> 1:13:52.006
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:54.930
And, Mr. Wick...

1:14:34.763 --> 1:14:38.023
<i>JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.</i>

1:14:38.099 --> 1:14:40.889
<i>JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.</i>

1:16:03.601 --> 1:16:05.351
Stick together, kids.

1:16:05.437 --> 1:16:09.317
Make sure you're holding the hand
of the person in front and behind you.

1:16:12.152 --> 1:16:15.412
You see?
That's why you're special, John Wick.

1:16:18.742 --> 1:16:20.452
I wouldn't have stopped.

1:16:21.953 --> 1:16:23.543
It's good to have you back.

1:16:30.462 --> 1:16:31.632
How was your trip?

1:16:34.924 --> 1:16:36.474
Going to the Continental?

1:16:43.057 --> 1:16:44.057
He with you?

1:16:45.769 --> 1:16:47.059
He was.

1:16:57.363 --> 1:16:58.783
Nice trick.

1:20:06.511 --> 1:20:09.351
Sir! Put your weapon down.

1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:12.270
He's Excommunicado.

1:20:13.434 --> 1:20:19.944
Unless you wish to become the same,
I suggest you lower your gun.

1:20:25.989 --> 1:20:28.069
I'd like to see the manager.

1:20:30.618 --> 1:20:31.618
Of course.

1:20:32.745 --> 1:20:35.035
If you would be so kind as to follow me.

1:20:48.428 --> 1:20:51.888
Please take a seat.
I will let him know you have arrived.

1:21:27.050 --> 1:21:28.550
I got to tell you,

1:21:28.634 --> 1:21:31.764
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

1:21:31.846 --> 1:21:35.216
I'm a huge fan, John Wick.

1:21:37.018 --> 1:21:39.058
And so far, you haven't disappointed.

1:21:43.733 --> 1:21:46.573
Is that the dog? He likes you.

1:21:48.112 --> 1:21:51.992
Me? I'm more of a cat person myself.

1:21:52.950 --> 1:21:53.950
Hey, d09-

1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:01.630
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

1:22:02.043 --> 1:22:03.173
We're not the same.

1:22:04.003 --> 1:22:05.303
Yes, we are.

1:22:06.214 --> 1:22:07.304
No, we're not.

1:22:09.008 --> 1:22:13.048
The manager is ready for you now.
In the administrative lounge, sir.

1:22:27.735 --> 1:22:29.195
Mr. Wick.

1:22:31.405 --> 1:22:32.405
Sit.

1:22:33.825 --> 1:22:35.155
Stay.

1:22:36.577 --> 1:22:37.657
Good dog.

1:23:33.926 --> 1:23:36.096
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

1:23:44.687 --> 1:23:48.187
We only use this room
on special occasions.

1:23:48.274 --> 1:23:52.284
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

1:23:52.361 --> 1:23:53.741
under the table.

1:23:55.865 --> 1:23:57.905
How was your journey here? Eventful?

1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:00.290
Yeah.

1:24:00.369 --> 1:24:01.369
Well, of course.

1:24:02.663 --> 1:24:06.793
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

1:24:08.169 --> 1:24:09.799
Isn't that why you're here?

1:24:10.171 --> 1:24:14.551
I have served, I will be of service.

1:24:16.761 --> 1:24:18.051
But you're having doubts.

1:24:19.889 --> 1:24:22.559
Just don't make the mistake of pretending
this is personal.

1:24:23.517 --> 1:24:25.437
If you feel you must...

1:24:28.064 --> 1:24:30.154
put a bullet through my heart.

1:24:36.948 --> 1:24:39.278
The High Table has asked me to step down.

1:24:39.742 --> 1:24:40.792
The hour?

1:24:41.577 --> 1:24:42.827
The hour.

1:24:42.912 --> 1:24:45.162
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

1:24:46.332 --> 1:24:47.632
Maybe I should have.

1:24:48.751 --> 1:24:50.921
Rules and consequences.

1:24:52.922 --> 1:24:56.382
It seems like everyone is suffering
from the consequences of their actions.

1:24:56.968 --> 1:24:58.758
And you're not stepping down?

1:25:01.180 --> 1:25:02.220
No.

1:25:03.557 --> 1:25:04.677
I don't think I am.

1:25:05.518 --> 1:25:06.978
So it's war?

1:25:07.561 --> 1:25:09.561
You're going to war with The High Table?

1:25:10.189 --> 1:25:11.189
Skirmish.

1:25:11.732 --> 1:25:13.192
Unless you decide to shoot me.

1:25:13.276 --> 1:25:16.646
But then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

1:25:17.321 --> 1:25:18.571
than that of an enemy.

1:25:20.074 --> 1:25:22.664
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

1:25:24.495 --> 1:25:25.785
What choice?

1:25:26.998 --> 1:25:29.418
You shoot me, you sell your soul.

1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:33.090
But I'll be alive. And I can remember her.

1:25:33.170 --> 1:25:36.510
Until you die as a servant
of The High Table.

1:25:36.590 --> 1:25:40.590
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

1:25:41.220 --> 1:25:44.560
You only came back
because Helen was taken away from you.

1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:48.350
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

1:25:49.228 --> 1:25:50.308
The Baba Yaga?

1:25:50.896 --> 1:25:52.896
The last thing many men ever see?

1:25:52.982 --> 1:25:57.492
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

1:25:58.070 --> 1:26:00.570
Who do you wish to die as, Jonathan?

1:26:32.813 --> 1:26:37.443
Mr. Wick, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I am an Adjudicator.

1:26:39.028 --> 1:26:40.648
Have you decided to step down?

1:26:43.407 --> 1:26:44.657
I think not.

1:26:46.285 --> 1:26:49.245
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

1:26:52.750 --> 1:26:55.540
No, I don't think I Will.

1:27:03.636 --> 1:27:04.796
Very well.

1:27:13.229 --> 1:27:14.859
Administration.

1:27:14.939 --> 1:27:16.689
<i>I'd like to change a designation.</i>

1:27:17.775 --> 1:27:18.895
Verification?

1:27:18.984 --> 1:27:22.114
<i>Adjudication 1-0-1 -1 -9-7-9.</i>

1:27:22.196 --> 1:27:24.276
The Continental Hotel, New York.

1:27:24.365 --> 1:27:25.735
<i>New designation?</i>

1:27:26.283 --> 1:27:27.583
Deconsecrated.

1:27:30.413 --> 1:27:31.413
Processing.

1:27:33.999 --> 1:27:35.039
Administrator.

1:27:36.460 --> 1:27:40.050
File. The New York Continental Hotel.

1:27:51.225 --> 1:27:55.345
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

1:28:02.945 --> 1:28:05.405
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

1:28:05.489 --> 1:28:08.239
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

1:28:08.325 --> 1:28:12.535
Since you are refusing to step down
and you are refusing a direct order,

1:28:12.621 --> 1:28:14.461
your lives are now forfeit.

1:28:14.874 --> 1:28:17.084
High Table emissaries
will be joining you presently

1:28:17.168 --> 1:28:19.668
to see the removal
of your souls from the property.

1:28:21.172 --> 1:28:23.012
Good evening, gentlemen.

1:28:27.344 --> 1:28:30.474
This haven is safe no more.

1:28:33.225 --> 1:28:35.805
Are services still off limits to me?

1:28:36.729 --> 1:28:40.109
Under the circumstances, your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

1:28:40.191 --> 1:28:41.441
What do you need?

1:28:42.193 --> 1:28:45.243
Guns. Lots of guns.

1:29:03.631 --> 1:29:05.591
Let's make a withdrawal.

1:29:29.823 --> 1:29:33.703
Remember, sir,
these will be High Table forces.

1:29:33.786 --> 1:29:36.206
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

1:29:36.872 --> 1:29:38.122
Why?

1:29:38.207 --> 1:29:39.827
Much has changed during your time away.

1:29:40.543 --> 1:29:41.923
Like what?

1:29:42.002 --> 1:29:44.672
Well, let us say
they have made armor improvements.

1:29:52.638 --> 1:29:56.478
May I suggest the 2011 Combat Master

1:29:56.559 --> 1:29:58.809
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

1:30:10.406 --> 1:30:12.156
<i>Attention, all guests.</i>

1:30:12.241 --> 1:30:14.701
<i>The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.</i>

1:30:15.661 --> 1:30:19.331
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience.
Please make your way to the nearest exit.</i>

1:30:24.253 --> 1:30:26.963
<i>Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...</i>

1:30:27.047 --> 1:30:30.587
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

1:30:30.676 --> 1:30:33.846
Your transaction may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

1:30:39.685 --> 1:30:42.855
We'll be sending some of our finest
for additional support.

1:30:42.938 --> 1:30:45.858
Cool. Very cool.

1:30:50.821 --> 1:30:57.041
One twenty-five grain,
1,425 feet per second. Serious business.

1:31:00.748 --> 1:31:01.748
Thank you.

1:31:02.333 --> 1:31:04.003
Let us begin.

1:32:50.274 --> 1:32:53.114
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

1:32:53.986 --> 1:32:55.196
Of course, sir.

1:33:17.050 --> 1:33:19.640
I know you'll do the Continental proud.

1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:21.260
I'll see you soon, sir.

1:33:24.391 --> 1:33:27.481
And you, Jonathan, do what you do best.

1:33:28.061 --> 1:33:29.061
What's that?

1:33:29.980 --> 1:33:31.190
Hunt

1:37:04.903 --> 1:37:08.033
Winston! Winston!

1:37:12.494 --> 1:37:14.044
I need more firepower.

1:37:37.394 --> 1:37:38.944
Armor improvements.

1:37:39.521 --> 1:37:42.361
Twelve-gauge steel slugs. Armor-piercing.

1:41:09.814 --> 1:41:11.734
Only by my sword, John.

1:41:24.329 --> 1:41:26.329
<i>I know you believe you can keep this up.</i>

1:41:26.414 --> 1:41:27.624
<i>But I assure you--</i>

1:49:32.817 --> 1:49:35.487
John, you're incredible.

1:49:36.404 --> 1:49:41.244
Exhausted, outnumbered, obviously in pain,

1:49:42.577 --> 1:49:45.117
and you still beat all of my students.

1:49:45.455 --> 1:49:50.075
If I didn't have to kill you,
we'd be... pals.

1:49:51.085 --> 1:49:52.165
Let's do this.

1:50:20.114 --> 1:50:22.244
See? We're the same.

1:54:09.218 --> 1:54:11.218
I would like to suggest a parley.

1:54:11.971 --> 1:54:13.511
A parley would be good.

1:54:13.597 --> 1:54:14.597
<i>Very well.</i>

1:54:26.235 --> 1:54:27.775
Are we in play, sir?

1:54:29.447 --> 1:54:30.777
Oh, very much so.

1:54:50.301 --> 1:54:51.761
Hey, John.

1:54:54.221 --> 1:54:56.311
That was a pretty good fight, huh?

1:55:00.436 --> 1:55:01.436
Yeah.

1:55:31.258 --> 1:55:32.338
Yeah.

1:55:33.094 --> 1:55:35.724
Don't worry about me, John.

1:55:36.764 --> 1:55:38.394
I just got to catch my breath.

1:55:40.726 --> 1:55:42.306
I'll catch up to you, John.

1:55:47.733 --> 1:55:48.863
No, you won't.

1:56:00.162 --> 1:56:03.502
You gentlemen, of course,
realize that was the first wave.

1:56:03.582 --> 1:56:05.252
Merely an am use-Douche.

1:56:06.168 --> 1:56:09.548
We can keep this up as long as you'd like,
but it only ends one way.

1:56:09.630 --> 1:56:12.010
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

1:56:12.091 --> 1:56:14.341
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

1:56:14.426 --> 1:56:16.716
Oh, you can take the Continental,
I have no doubt about that,

1:56:16.804 --> 1:56:19.524
but keeping it,
that's a different matter entirely.

1:56:19.598 --> 1:56:22.478
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

1:56:23.561 --> 1:56:24.981
We are High Table.

1:56:25.771 --> 1:56:27.021
And we...

1:56:28.232 --> 1:56:29.982
are New York City.

1:56:31.026 --> 1:56:32.526
Are we negotiating?

1:56:36.282 --> 1:56:37.662
I believe we are.

1:56:43.414 --> 1:56:44.424
Parley?

1:56:45.291 --> 1:56:46.671
Parley.

1:56:50.254 --> 1:56:52.304
What do you propose we do?

1:56:56.594 --> 1:56:58.394
Let me keep my power.

1:56:59.096 --> 1:57:00.096
Under The Table.

1:57:03.058 --> 1:57:07.558
I have served
and been a beacon of order and stability

1:57:07.646 --> 1:57:09.766
to our industry for over 40 years.

1:57:09.857 --> 1:57:14.737
Now, I humbly acknowledge I overstepped
and re-pledge my fealty to The High Table.

1:57:18.032 --> 1:57:19.122
Winston.

1:57:24.830 --> 1:57:28.960
You were merely showing strength
so we would let you keep the Continental.

1:57:32.713 --> 1:57:34.923
The High Table accepts your fealty.

1:57:36.884 --> 1:57:38.144
But what about him?

1:57:40.346 --> 1:57:43.846
What are we going to do about John Wick?

1:57:49.480 --> 1:57:50.860
Oh, he has to die.

1:57:52.441 --> 1:57:53.441
Sorry, Jonathan.

1:57:53.984 --> 1:57:55.614
- Winston!
- Don't see any other way.

1:58:07.831 --> 1:58:12.671
Very well, gentlemen.
The Continental will now be reconsecrated.

1:58:13.837 --> 1:58:15.047
Good day to you both.

1:58:19.718 --> 1:58:21.048
Well played, sir.

1:58:56.630 --> 1:58:58.970
How long do you estimate until we reopen?

1:58:59.675 --> 1:59:01.255
Oh, should be no time at all.

1:59:05.431 --> 1:59:06.811
Mr. Wick is gone.

1:59:07.474 --> 1:59:08.774
A true tragedy.

1:59:09.184 --> 1:59:12.864
You misunderstand.
I mean that he is no longer on the street.

1:59:13.605 --> 1:59:14.645
That seems improbable.

1:59:14.732 --> 1:59:16.032
And yet, true.

1:59:17.735 --> 1:59:20.235
<i>I trust you understand
the repercussions if he survives.</i>

1:59:20.321 --> 1:59:22.201
<i>Both from above and below.</i>

1:59:22.990 --> 1:59:26.990
The last thing either one of us needs is
Mr. Wick paying us a visit in the night.

1:59:29.872 --> 1:59:31.922
For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it

1:59:31.999 --> 1:59:34.249
that this situation is taken care of, yes?

1:59:34.335 --> 1:59:37.915
Absolutely. How far can he get?

1:59:49.516 --> 1:59:50.516
Baba Yaga.

2:00:22.216 --> 2:00:23.966
How you doing, John?

2:00:24.676 --> 2:00:26.926
You look as bad as I feel.

2:00:29.181 --> 2:00:31.061
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

2:00:32.017 --> 2:00:33.887
Raise a hand if you can hear me, John.

2:00:37.064 --> 2:00:41.284
Oh, shit. They took a finger.
Ain't that a bitch?

2:00:48.867 --> 2:00:51.327
John fucking Wick.

2:00:52.037 --> 2:00:55.617
So, the old boy keeps his hotel
and you take the fall.

2:00:56.250 --> 2:00:57.250
Can't say I blame him.

2:00:57.334 --> 2:00:59.554
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

2:01:00.671 --> 2:01:03.301
But this High Table shit...

2:01:06.385 --> 2:01:08.095
Seven cuts.

2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:14.060
Under The Table is where shit gets done.

2:01:16.228 --> 2:01:19.268
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

2:01:19.356 --> 2:01:21.016
you better cut him to the quick.

2:01:26.238 --> 2:01:27.448
So...

2:01:29.992 --> 2:01:31.372
Let me ask you, John.

2:01:32.411 --> 2:01:33.411
How do you feel?

2:01:36.206 --> 2:01:40.336
'Cause I am really pissed off.

2:01:41.295 --> 2:01:42.875
You pissed, John?

2:01:44.465 --> 2:01:45.465
Are you?

2:01:55.392 --> 2:01:56.892
Yeah.
