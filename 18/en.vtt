WEBVTT

03:38.120 --> 03:39.680
Almost.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.590
"Almost."

03:42.720 --> 03:45.520
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

03:45.600 --> 03:49.640
- Why can't we just correct the problem?
- Because my fuckin' nephew...

03:50.920 --> 03:52.400
killed a dog.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.470
And he stole a car.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.160
A car...

03:59.320 --> 04:02.280
which currently is among our inventory.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.320
So we're giving everything up for a car?

04:11.240 --> 04:12.670
It's not just a car.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.990
It is John Wick's car.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.080
Oh.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.190
Sir, why don't we just give it back?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.310
He killed my nephew.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.190
My brother.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.080
And a dozen of my men.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.310
Over his car.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.950
And a puppy.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.830
And you... you think he will stop now?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.200
Hmm?

04:56.160 --> 04:57.990
Sir, he's one man.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.560
Why don't we just eliminate him?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.470
John Wick...

05:06.560 --> 05:09.000
is a man of focus...

05:13.200 --> 05:14.480
commitment...

05:21.480 --> 05:24.310
and sheer fuckin' will.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.400
He once killed three men in a bar...

05:42.480 --> 05:44.870
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.520
With a fucking pencil!

05:47.760 --> 05:49.430
Who the fuck can do that?

05:51.920 --> 05:53.430
Well, I can assure you

05:55.240 --> 05:58.280
that the stories you hear about this man,

05:59.280 --> 06:05.360
if nothing else, has been watered down.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.070
...Mr. Wick.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.640
Hey, buddy.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.870
Hey.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.190
Good dog.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.120
- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.350
What are you doing?

16:27.440 --> 16:28.840
I'm waiting for you.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.030
Come here.

16:46.680 --> 16:47.830
Hey, boy.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.990
Nice peaceful place you got here.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.120
- Hey, Aurelio.
- Hey.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.950
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.240
What do you think?

17:28.320 --> 17:30.790
Well, your motor's
about to fall out and...

17:31.800 --> 17:32.920
the chassis' all bent up,

17:34.000 --> 17:35.990
the... the driveshaft is all destroyed.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.800
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.240
I mean... what do I think?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.160
I could fix this.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.110
Thanks for finding her.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.320
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.630
Let me know when it's fixed.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.270
All right. It'll be ready Christmas...

18:00.360 --> 18:01.710
2030.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.830
Ciao, John.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.550
Santino.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.680
Café?

20:05.680 --> 20:06.910
Grazie.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.280
Good to see you.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.600
Good to see you.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.990
I was sorry to hear about your wife, John.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.600
Thank you.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.550
Hi.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.240
And the dog, does he have a name?

20:50.440 --> 20:51.510
No.

21:00.720 --> 21:04.430
Listen, John... with all sincerity...

21:06.520 --> 21:07.840
I don't want to be here.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.590
Please, don't.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.510
I'm asking you not to do this.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.670
I'm sorry.

21:19.400 --> 21:25.350
No one gets out and comes back
without repercussions.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.040
I do this with a heavy heart, John.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.120
But remember, if not for what I did

21:37.200 --> 21:40.270
on the night of your impossible task,

21:40.400 --> 21:44.360
you wouldn't be here right now, like this.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.350
This is because of me.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.950
This, in part, is mine.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.110
Take it back.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.320
- "Take it back"?
- Take it back.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.150
A marker is no small thing, John.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.550
For a man to grant a marker to another,

22:01.640 --> 22:04.160
is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.160
Find someone else.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.350
Listen to me.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.840
What is this? Hmm?

22:17.840 --> 22:20.310
Do you remember? This is your blood.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.350
You came to me. I helped you.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.200
If you don't do this,

22:28.280 --> 22:30.560
you know the consequences.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.640
I'm not that guy anymore.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.120
You are always that guy, John.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.270
I can't help you.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.920
I'm sorry.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.590
Yes. You're right.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.750
You can't.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.200
But he can.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.920
I'll see you soon, John.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.560
You have a beautiful home, John.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.120
Buenasera.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.520
Well, good evenin', John.

26:00.520 --> 26:01.800
Hey, Jimmy.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.480
Gas leak?

26:07.520 --> 26:09.080
Yeah, gas leak.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.320
You workin' again?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.630
I'll see you, Jimmy.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.830
Come on, boy.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.510
'Night, John.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.230
Oh, shit.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.790
I'd like to see the manager.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.600
How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.880
Shall I announce you?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.230
Yes, please.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.710
Stay.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.080
Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.630
Impeccable.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.800
Put these into circulation.

28:07.640 --> 28:08.840
Where is he?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.600
Thank you, my friend.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.750
Beautiful work. Beautiful.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.680
What are you doing, Jonathan?

28:25.080 --> 28:27.280
He burned my house down.

28:27.360 --> 28:30.560
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

28:31.960 --> 28:36.190
What the hell were you thinking, giving
a marker to a man like Santino D'Antonio?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.840
It was the only way I could get out.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.830
Oh. You call this "out"?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.960
What did you think was gonna happen? Huh?

28:46.040 --> 28:47.840
What did you expect? Huh?

28:47.920 --> 28:51.550
Did you really think this day
was never going to come? Hmm?

28:54.040 --> 28:55.680
What does he want you to do?

28:57.840 --> 28:59.160
I didn't ask.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.360
I just said no.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.080
Two rules that cannot be broken, Jonathan.

29:08.080 --> 29:12.070
No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

29:13.320 --> 29:16.840
Now while my judgment comes
in the form of excommunicado,

29:17.840 --> 29:19.720
the High Table

29:19.800 --> 29:22.950
demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.190
I have no choice?

29:27.520 --> 29:29.430
You dishonor the marker, you die.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.640
You kill the holder of the marker,
you die.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.870
You run, you die.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.520
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.190
Do what the man asks.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.800
Be free.

29:42.880 --> 29:48.040
Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.440
But until then...

29:52.200 --> 29:53.350
Rules.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.350
Exactly. Rules.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.710
Without them, we'd live with the animals.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.590
Do you board?

30:10.880 --> 30:13.920
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

30:15.600 --> 30:21.360
I, however, would be willing to accept
the responsibility, should you wish.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.400
Appreciate that.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.200
Does he have a name, sir?

30:26.280 --> 30:27.270
No.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.510
Good dog.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.630
Stay.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.390
This was my father's collection.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.200
I see little more
than just paint on canvas, of course.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.480
But I do find myself here.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.710
Please.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.040
I didn't want to do this, John.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.560
Had you stayed retired,
I would have respected it.

32:10.680 --> 32:11.750
Look at you.

32:12.920 --> 32:15.120
You're thinkin' about it, aren't you?

32:16.400 --> 32:19.870
You're counting exits... guards...

32:21.720 --> 32:23.550
Could you get to me in time?

32:25.880 --> 32:27.680
How would you do it, I wonder?

32:29.920 --> 32:30.910
That woman's pen?

32:33.440 --> 32:34.430
His cane?

32:36.720 --> 32:37.920
Maybe his glasses?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.600
My hands.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.000
Ah. How exciting.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.720
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

32:49.040 --> 32:52.800
I told you I needed that guy,

32:52.880 --> 32:55.190
the way you are looking at me right now.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.790
I needed the Boogeyman.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.360
I needed John Wick.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.350
Just... tell me what you want.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.240
I want you to kill my sister.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.590
Why?

33:14.720 --> 33:18.000
There are 12 seats at the High Table.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.240
Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.150
The Chinese, the Russian.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.520
When my father died...

33:31.120 --> 33:33.240
he willed his seat to her.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.830
She represents Camorra now.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.280
And I can't help but wonder...

33:41.680 --> 33:44.200
what I might accomplish in her stead.

33:46.040 --> 33:51.510
You want me to kill... Gianna D'Antonio?

33:54.240 --> 33:55.440
I could never do it.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.110
She is my blood.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.270
I still love her.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.840
It can't be done.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.470
She's in Rome for her coronation.

34:06.480 --> 34:11.000
- You will take the catacombs in...
- It doesn't matter where she is.

34:11.080 --> 34:16.240
That's why I need the ghost,
lo spettro, John Wick.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.040
That's why I need you.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.390
Do this for me,

34:22.400 --> 34:24.310
and your marker is honored.

34:25.680 --> 34:27.320
What say you?

34:35.120 --> 34:36.950
Never one to waste words.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.990
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.560
Jonathan!

37:01.960 --> 37:03.310
Julius.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.280
- Ciao.
- Nice to see you.

37:13.080 --> 37:16.280
I fail to recall the last time
you were in Rome.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.830
And here I'd heard

37:19.840 --> 37:21.070
you had retired.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.840
I had.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.600
Then humor me with, uh...
but one question.

37:38.680 --> 37:39.830
No.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.480
All right, then.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.040
One of our finest rooms.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.800
Grazie.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.560
Enjoy your stay.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.070
Mr. Wick.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.120
Is the sommelier in?

38:30.200 --> 38:32.080
I have never known him not to be.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.800
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.680
It's been a long time.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.320
I'd like a tasting.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.390
I am quite excited to show you something.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.830
First...

39:05.960 --> 39:08.240
Buongiorno, Signor Wick.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.310
Ciao, Angelo.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.830
Welcome back to Rome.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.750
I am.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.910
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

39:18.040 --> 39:22.190
but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.920
Glock.34 and.26.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.720
This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.270
Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

39:34.920 --> 39:38.800
Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or a social affair?

39:38.880 --> 39:42.760
- Social.
- And is this for day or evening?

39:42.840 --> 39:45.070
I need one for day and one for night.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.390
Recontoured grips.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.470
Flared magwell for easier reloads.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.950
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.430
What's next?

39:57.520 --> 40:01.150
I need something robust. Precise.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.070
"Robust. Precise."

40:05.360 --> 40:10.750
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.560
- In what style?
- Italian.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.240
- How many buttons?
- Two.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.990
- Trousers?
- Tapered.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.280
How about the lining?

40:17.360 --> 40:18.950
Tactical.

40:20.280 --> 40:24.120
AR-15, 11.5-inch.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.110
Compensated
with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.160
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

40:30.280 --> 40:34.350
And this is the modern blueprint.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.750
There are one, two, three gates.

40:40.360 --> 40:43.320
Silicon carbide discs. Ceramic matrices.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.040
Accompanying laminates.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.870
Cutting-edge body armor.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.640
We just sew it between the fabric
and the lining.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.400
Zero penetration. However...

40:54.760 --> 40:56.190
quite painful, I'm afraid.

40:56.280 --> 40:59.640
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

40:59.720 --> 41:01.840
Something big, bold.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.310
May I suggest the Benelli M4?

41:09.880 --> 41:11.920
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.200
Textured grips,
should your hands get... wet.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.150
An Italian classic.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.280
Dessert?

41:22.360 --> 41:24.480
Dessert.

41:25.480 --> 41:29.270
The finest cutlery. All freshly stoned.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.280
Well done.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.350
- Could you do a rush order?
- I sure can.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.240
Where would you like to have it sent?

41:44.320 --> 41:45.360
The hotel.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.070
Shall I have everything sent to your room?

41:48.080 --> 41:50.360
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excellent.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.160
Mr. Wick?

41:56.800 --> 41:58.680
Do enjoy your party.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.270
Good evening.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.150
Are you enjoying the party?

46:45.520 --> 46:47.000
Mr. Akoni.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.390
Are you enjoying the festivities?

46:58.600 --> 47:00.430
Please. Sit.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.560
Ms. D'Antonio,

47:06.640 --> 47:08.840
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine...

47:08.920 --> 47:10.120
Nothing was taken.

47:11.280 --> 47:14.720
Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.360
A knife was pressed to their throats.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.350
Semantics.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.430
Besides...

47:21.440 --> 47:24.750
That blade you speak of was meant
for their children.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.440
They were only meant to watch.

47:29.560 --> 47:33.240
What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.470
Now go.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.000
Enjoy the party.

47:42.520 --> 47:44.030
Have some fun.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.790
Sì, signora.

48:42.760 --> 48:43.990
John.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.070
Gianna.

48:53.360 --> 48:58.670
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.720
I still do.

49:07.480 --> 49:08.680
Yet here you are.

49:15.920 --> 49:17.990
What brought you back, John?

49:19.440 --> 49:20.840
A marker.

49:22.920 --> 49:23.990
Held by?

49:26.440 --> 49:27.870
Your brother.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.030
Tell me, John.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.550
This marker...

49:41.080 --> 49:42.590
Is it how you got out?

49:45.440 --> 49:46.510
And what was her name,

49:47.520 --> 49:50.160
this woman whose life has ended my own?

49:52.760 --> 49:54.040
Helen.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.230
"Helen."

49:59.400 --> 50:00.910
This Helen...

50:02.840 --> 50:05.910
was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

50:12.880 --> 50:14.280
Now...

50:16.840 --> 50:19.280
let me tell you what happens when I die.

50:20.280 --> 50:23.430
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the Table.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.550
He will take New York.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.960
And you... will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.830
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

51:45.160 --> 51:47.550
What would your Helen think about you?

51:48.560 --> 51:49.680
Hmm?

52:04.880 --> 52:06.160
Why?

52:11.560 --> 52:13.120
Because...

52:13.200 --> 52:16.430
I lived my life my way.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.150
And I'll die my way.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.950
Do you fear damnation, John?

52:40.000 --> 52:41.150
Yes.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.190
You know,

52:50.200 --> 52:53.720
I always thought I could escape it.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.720
That I'd see it coming.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.280
That I'd see you.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.150
John?

54:22.880 --> 54:24.200
Cassian.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.750
You working?

54:30.280 --> 54:32.080
Yeah.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.150
You?

54:34.600 --> 54:35.750
Yeah.

54:39.200 --> 54:40.350
Good night?

54:43.120 --> 54:44.440
Afraid so.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.200
I'm sorry to hear that.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.600
Loose ends?

57:59.160 --> 58:00.480
Yeah...

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:24.200
You're not havin' a good night,
are you, John?

1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:51.390
Gentlemen!

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:55.040
Gentlemen!

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:09.030
Do I need to remind you

1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:10.760
that there will be no business

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:13.400
conducted on the Continental grounds?

1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:15.920
No, signore.

1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:18.360
No, sir.

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:21.150
Bene.

1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:27.600
Now, may I suggest a visit to the bar,

1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:29.160
so you can calm yourselves.

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:35.160
Gin, wasn't it?

1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:37.350
Yes.

1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:41.710
Bourbon, right?

1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:44.230
Yeah.

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.390
I had a marker.

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:15.590
Whose?

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:18.200
Her brother.

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:24.510
I see.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:27.910
You had no choice.

1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:35.000
He wants her seat at the Table.

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:38.400
He will get it now.

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:42.600
Yeah.

1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:45.390
Yeah.

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:49.150
So you're free.

1:06:56.280 --> 1:06:57.430
Am I?

1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:01.000
No.

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.360
Not at all.

1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:11.120
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.

1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:14.950
An eye for an eye, John.

1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:18.030
You know how it goes.

1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:21.480
Yeah.

1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:29.560
I'll make it quick.

1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:32.200
I promise.

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:35.830
I appreciate that.

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.070
I'll try and do the same.

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:50.040
This round's on me.

1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:55.470
Consider it a professional courtesy.

1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:31.750
No. Thanks.

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:36.550
Hello, John.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.920
I understand if you're upset.

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.720
And I know it might feel personal.

1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:44.080
But what kind of man would I be

1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:45.920
if I didn't avenge my sister's murder?

1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:48.990
John?

1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:09.280
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out in the morning.

1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:50.320
Operator. How may I direct your call?

1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:52.680
- Accounts payable.
- One moment, please.

1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:06.470
Accounts payable.

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:07.710
How may I help you?

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.080
I'd like to open an account.

1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:11.590
- Name on the account?
- John Wick.

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:13.320
Verification?

1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:15.230
9305-05.

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:18.360
State of contract?

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:21.240
- Open.
- Denomination?

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:23.990
Seven million.

1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:26.200
Processing. Please hold.

1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:32.240
- I appreciate the service.
- My pleasure.

1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:34.550
You will find safe passage below.

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:40.360
Transportation is waiting for you.

1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:46.600
May you have a safe journey, Mr. Wick.

1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:19.030
Order confirmed.

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:25.160
- What is this?
- He completed the task.

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:28.230
The marker is over.

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.230
Mark it.

1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:34.080
If Mr. Wick isn't dead already,

1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:35.480
he soon will be.

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.720
Will you mark it, sir?

1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:57.800
You have no idea what's coming, do you?

1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:03.150
I have everyone in New York
looking for him.

1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:05.550
I doubt we will see him again.

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:09.750
Do you now?

1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:14.400
You stabbed the devil in the back

1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:17.710
and forced him back
into the life that he had just left.

1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:22.440
You incinerated the priest's temple.

1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:23.710
Burned it to the ground.

1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:28.760
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.040
He had a glimpse of the other side

1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:35.680
and he embraced it.

1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:37.640
But you, Signor D'Antonio...

1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:40.040
took it away from him.

1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:42.510
He was already back.

1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:45.200
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.750
He owed me. I had every right.

1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:51.750
And now he's coming again.

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.400
He did tell you not to do this.

1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:00.080
He did warn you.

1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:03.120
Addio, Santino.

1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:11.840
Please notify MTA personnel of
any suspicious activity.

1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:21.720
Your attention, please.

1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:25.270
The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.

1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:28.190
Your attention, please.

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:31.640
The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:47.360
Next stop, Canal Street.

1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:09.520
This is Canal Street.

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:15.390
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:17.790
Next stop is Rector Street.

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:44.950
This is Rector Street.

1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:52.840
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:56.200
The next stop is Broad Street.

1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:21.720
This is Broad Street.

1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:24.470
This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.

1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:26.760
The blade is in your aorta.

1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:29.040
You pull it out, you will bleed,
and you will die.

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:31.520
This is the end of the line.

1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:37.320
Consider this a professional courtesy.

1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:40.310
This is Broad Street.

1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:43.520
This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.

1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:47.320
This is the end of the line.

1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:26.470
We see things, we see things.

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:29.840
The things you see are nightmares, man.

1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:31.990
Like this one time...

1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:36.830
Take me to him.

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.990
Tell him it's John Wick.

1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:01.040
You know, they just...
they put it in everything!

1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:02.320
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:56.000
As I live and breathe!

1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:58.640
John Wick.

1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:00.630
The man.

1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:03.150
The myth.

1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:04.470
The legend.

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:09.040
You're not very good at retiring.

1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:10.790
I'm workin' on it.

1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:15.430
Mr. Wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:17.320
before my ascension...

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:21.240
When I was just a pawn in the game.

1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:25.800
We met and you gave me a gift,

1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:27.630
the gift that would make me a king.

1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:33.430
You don't remember, but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:36.680
I didn't even hear you comin'.

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:42.520
You gave me this.

1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:48.400
Gift from the Boogeyman.

1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:51.920
Perfect for every occasion.

1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:56.800
But you also gave me a choice.

1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:01.760
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back, and die,

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:04.040
or keep the pressure on my neck...

1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:06.720
and live.

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:10.550
And so you see, I survived.

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.840
No one sneaks up on me anymore,
thanks to you.

1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:20.510
I am all-seeing and all-knowing.

1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:24.630
Then you know why I'm here.

1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:29.720
Santino D'Antonio, yes.

1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:32.400
Your contract went wide, John.

1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:35.360
That's bad for your health.

1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:38.190
What's the number up to now, Earl?

1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:41.720
Seven million dollars!

1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:42.790
Damn!

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.990
It's Christmas.
We're going to Applebee's after this.

1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:52.920
I need your help.

1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:56.760
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.

1:27:56.840 --> 1:27:59.040
I'm thinkin' you can find Santino.

1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:03.120
I need you to move me. Underground.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:04.480
Get me to him.

1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:08.000
How sweet it is!

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.560
The Boogeyman begging me for help.

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:13.480
Well, of course, John.

1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:16.160
Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:18.990
Would you like a back rub with that, John?

1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:21.720
You're going to help me.

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.200
Why the fuck would I do that?

1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:29.390
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.400
You're gonna help me out?

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:53.350
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:57.150
You sound positively magnanimous.

1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:00.510
But look around you.

1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:04.070
How much help does it look like I need?

1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:16.030
It seems to me that the real question,
Mr. Wick,

1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:21.320
is who in this cruel world of ours...
is going to help you?

1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:37.350
There's a storm coming.

1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:41.070
Not just for me. For all of us.

1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:43.720
For everyone under the Table.

1:29:43.800 --> 1:29:47.510
Yes, killing someone who has a seat
at the High Table does create a problem.

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:49.430
But it's your problem, baby.

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:55.040
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna D'Antonio...

1:29:55.160 --> 1:29:56.750
to the hereafter.

1:29:58.280 --> 1:30:02.160
That being said, Santino has her seat now.

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:04.440
And he wants the city.

1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:08.510
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:12.510
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.

1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:13.800
Oh, yeah?

1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:16.270
For how long?

1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:17.680
And how much blood?

1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:20.400
You kill Santino,

1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:23.000
the Camorra,
and the High Table come for you.

1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:27.600
I kill Santino, they come for me.

1:30:28.960 --> 1:30:31.630
He's offered $7 million for your life.

1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:36.950
Seven million dollars
is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:45.120
So I guess you have a choice.

1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:47.920
You want a war?

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.310
Or do you wanna just give me a gun?

1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:05.870
Somebody, please! Get this man a gun!

1:31:12.520 --> 1:31:15.430
Kimber 1911,.45 ACP.

1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:20.510
Seven-round capacity.

1:31:28.920 --> 1:31:30.120
Seven rounds?

1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:34.800
Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:38.360
That's a million dollars a round, baby.

1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:51.070
Let's go.

1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:55.400
Your descent into Hell begins here,
Mr. Wick.

1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:56.710
He's at the museum.

1:31:56.800 --> 1:31:58.440
Earl will guide you.

1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:00.750
Do be careful on your way down.

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:05.790
Oh, and remember... you owe me.

1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:09.280
You don't want me owing you.

1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:40.640
Welcome, everyone.

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:43.870
Let us toast to the future
of the High Table

1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:47.110
and of course,
to the memory of my dear sister.

1:33:04.360 --> 1:33:06.080
Nice to see you.

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:17.640
Mr. Akoni, how are you?

1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:16.080
Wick is here.

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:17.150
Yeah.

1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:11.230
You and you, with me. You, go.

1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:29.350
Welcome to "Reflections of the Soul"

1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:31.720
at the New Modern NYC.

1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:34.870
Within this exhibition,

1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:38.190
the interplay of light
and the nature of self-images

1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:40.240
coalesce to provide an experience

1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:42.470
which will highlight the fragility

1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:46.520
of our perception of space
and our place within it.

1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:49.830
We hope through this exhibit
we can provide new insights

1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:51.960
into your understanding of the world,

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:55.560
and just possibly lead you
to deeper reflection

1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:57.230
into the nature of self.

1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.160
The marker is complete, John.

1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:16.830
You should have just run away.

1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:29.640
You know what the Camorra will do to you.

1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:33.190
You think you're Old Testament?

1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:35.600
No, John.

1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:38.950
No.

1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:43.400
Killing me won't stop the contract.

1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:48.960
Killing me will make it so much worse.

1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:53.110
John...

1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:55.720
you know what I think?

1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:00.720
I think you are addicted to it.

1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:01.790
To the vengeance.

1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:22.520
Welcome to "Reflections of the Soul"

1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:25.480
at the New Modern NYC.

1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:29.470
No wife.

1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:32.480
No life.

1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:35.750
No home.

1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:40.670
Vengeance... it's all you have.

1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.510
You wanted me back.

1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:46.600
I'm back.

1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:46.160
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul"

1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:47.720
at the New Modern NYC.

1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:50.920
We hope that your journey
through the exhibit

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:53.760
has been one of reflective contemplation

1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:56.360
allowing for a new perspective
and insight.

1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:04.430
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul..."

1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:27.400
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul..."

1:43:40.440 --> 1:43:41.920
Good evening.

1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:45.390
Is the manager in?

1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:48.840
The manager is always in.

1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:54.950
Winston.

1:43:56.640 --> 1:43:57.790
Mr. D'Antonio.

1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:00.800
Your evening has been colorful, I see.

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:03.950
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?

1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:07.560
I want his membership revoked. Now.

1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:12.000
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached no legalities.

1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:14.200
Then you know that I have the right
to demand...

1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:18.510
Nothing.
You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.

1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:21.320
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:26.030
All right.

1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:28.950
Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston,
while you still can.

1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:32.720
And you, its privileges, sir.

1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:48.200
I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.

1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:54.520
He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.

1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:47.110
Duck fat.

1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:48.760
Makes all the difference.

1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:51.240
Jonathan...

1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:52.440
Have you seen the menu here?

1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:56.400
- Lot of options.
- Jonathan, listen to me...

1:45:56.480 --> 1:45:59.920
A man can stay here a long time

1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:01.680
and never eat the same meal twice.

1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:06.040
Jonathan, just walk away.

1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:09.310
Yeah, Jonathan.

1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:10.910
Walk a...

1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:20.840
What have you done?

1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:25.870
Finished it.

1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:46.160
How was he?

1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:49.120
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:55.400
Let's go home.

1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:33.880
Mr. Wick?

1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:42.510
If you would be so inclined.

1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:17.830
Come on, boy.

1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:29.030
It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.

1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:37.360
Goodbye.

1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:15.950
Jonathan.

1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:17.190
Winston.

1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:20.160
What am I lookin' at?

1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:24.960
The Camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:26.240
It's gone international.

1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:28.760
High Table?

1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:29.830
Mmm-hmm.

1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:32.510
And the Continental?

1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:36.520
You killed a man on company grounds,
Jonathan.

1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:40.390
You leave me no choice
but to declare you excommunicado.

1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:46.280
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the Continental

1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:48.800
are now closed to you.

1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:54.190
I am so sorry.

1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:58.230
Your life is now forfeit.

1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:02.800
Then why am I not dead?

1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.480
Because I deemed it not to be.

1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:10.470
Now.

1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:41.480
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.

1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:44.750
You might need this...

1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:47.750
down the road.

1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:53.390
Winston...

1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.320
tell them.

1:51:57.480 --> 1:51:59.470
Tell them all.

1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:01.550
Whoever comes,

1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:02.960
whoever it is...

1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:05.480
I'll kill them.

1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:08.120
I'll kill them all.

1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:13.360
'Course you will.

1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:19.160
Jonathan.

1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:22.480
Winston.

1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:46.680
Accounts payable.

1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:53.350
One-one-one-one-one.

1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:57.190
In one hour.

1:52:58.200 --> 1:52:59.350
John Wick.

1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:02.920
Excommunicado.

1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:29.950
Order 11111 confirmed.
