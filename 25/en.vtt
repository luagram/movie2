00:59.064 --> 01:01.112
Omar, what's the status
on the general?

01:05.592 --> 01:07.768
No?

01:17.689 --> 01:18.681
Hamza.

02:34.489 --> 02:37.241
Where is General Fezzan?

I might be complicated,
but I ain't fucking hopeless.

03:55.672 --> 03:57.528
Is that what we
call it? Complicated?

03:57.657 --> 04:00.376
Well, whatever it's called,
it's not working, is it?

04:00.504 --> 04:03.417
Come on, Gina,
you're not looking at the big picture.

04:03.545 --> 04:04.633
What's the big picture?

04:04.761 --> 04:07.000
Is it you?
Are you my big picture?

04:07.128 --> 04:08.281
Oh, my God, thank you.

04:08.409 --> 04:09.849
You should get
the fuck over yourself.

04:09.976 --> 04:10.681
'Cause you know what
you actually are?

04:10.809 --> 04:11.832
A caveman.

04:12.792 --> 04:14.521
- You do resemble a caveman.
- You know what it is?

04:14.649 --> 04:16.345
- And you don't?
- You don't want competition.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.745
Gina, please,
calm down. That's what your problem is.

04:18.873 --> 04:20.536
Me calm down?
Did you just tell me..

04:20.665 --> 04:22.777
Don't tell me to fucking
calm down! I'm calm!

04:22.905 --> 04:25.657
I've never been
more fucking calm in my life.

04:26.105 --> 04:27.801
"Oh, look at me.

04:27.929 --> 04:30.905
I'm English. I'm avoidant.
I don't like to argue."

04:31.032 --> 04:32.409
Well, guess what?

04:32.537 --> 04:34.809
I just want a little peace
in my life. Right?

04:34.936 --> 04:36.409
- It'd be nice.
- I'm from America, bitch. We're gonna fight about it.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.585
Go. Just go. Go.
So what does that make me?

04:38.712 --> 04:39.961
Does that make me stressful?

04:40.089 --> 04:41.656
No, no, no.

04:42.777 --> 04:44.121
A little violent perhaps.

04:45.496 --> 04:46.777
I'm a professional.

04:46.905 --> 04:48.665
Yeah. And a little violent.

04:48.793 --> 04:49.529
A little bit.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.033
Teeny bit.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.313
You know what it is?

04:52.441 --> 04:54.040
I've got your skills
and then some.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.113
And neither of you like it
because you're both cavemen.

04:57.944 --> 04:59.353
She's talking to you.

04:59.481 --> 05:01.049
Actually, she's looking
in your direction.

05:01.177 --> 05:03.097
- I'm talking to you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:03.225 --> 05:04.313
But about you.

05:04.441 --> 05:06.169
You might be my boss,

05:06.297 --> 05:08.697
but I can tell that you're also
from this planet called "hopeless"

05:08.825 --> 05:11.033
where intimate relationships
and feelings

05:11.161 --> 05:13.049
don't fucking exist!

05:13.177 --> 05:16.025
Fucking baby. I've wasted
so much of my life on you.

05:16.152 --> 05:18.168
You are a loser.
But I like you.

05:18.297 --> 05:21.369
Thanks.
Why are you here?

05:21.497 --> 05:24.888
I lost my ring at this bar,
and I need you to..

05:25.017 --> 05:28.185
I'm sorry. Is that it?
Are we done talking?

05:28.313 --> 05:30.329
Are you done
with this conversation?

05:30.745 --> 05:31.833
Conversation?

05:31.961 --> 05:34.392
It's more like angry chatter.

05:34.521 --> 05:35.673
Fuck you.

05:36.473 --> 05:38.457
She's talking to you again.

05:39.288 --> 05:42.297
It's depressing.
No. It's okay.

05:50.297 --> 05:51.704
I liked her, Barney.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.225
She's an Expendable, Christmas.

05:55.353 --> 05:59.320
Look, I got great respect for
your uncanny abilities. I really do.

06:00.089 --> 06:02.169
But you are a selfish prick.

06:02.296 --> 06:03.577
Really?
We all are.

06:03.705 --> 06:05.849
We have to be
to choose this life

06:05.977 --> 06:07.545
over friends, over family.

06:07.673 --> 06:09.305
We do this for money.

06:10.265 --> 06:12.697
That's the definition of prickism.

06:12.824 --> 06:14.393
What do you think
of my analysis?

06:14.521 --> 06:15.449
Pretty good?

06:15.577 --> 06:18.457
I think you're a moron.

06:18.584 --> 06:19.705
You don't believe that.

06:19.833 --> 06:22.137
With every cell in my body.

06:22.521 --> 06:24.312
Why are we here?

06:24.441 --> 06:28.057
I lost my ring last night in a bet,
and I'm here to try to buy it back.

06:28.184 --> 06:29.080
Seriously?

06:29.209 --> 06:30.104
Yeah, seriously.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.641
A silly little trinket.

06:32.569 --> 06:35.065
I'm superstitious about it,
and I like it.

06:35.193 --> 06:37.113
Feel like I'm missing a finger.

06:39.449 --> 06:42.457
I tried getting it back,
but this half-ass won't negotiate.

06:42.584 --> 06:44.440
Who?
Jumbo Shrimp.

06:44.569 --> 06:45.913
Who's he?
You'll see.

06:46.745 --> 06:48.537
- What's up, Barney?
- Hey, Billy.

06:51.097 --> 06:54.457
So how'd you lose
your most prized possession?

06:56.089 --> 06:57.241
Thumb wrestling.

06:57.945 --> 06:59.417
You mean arm wrestling?
No.

06:59.545 --> 07:00.665
I mean thumb wrestling.

07:00.792 --> 07:02.649
Like that.
Give me your hand.

07:02.777 --> 07:04.345
No. Thumb wrestling?

07:05.081 --> 07:06.552
You used to be strong.
What happened?

07:06.681 --> 07:09.241
And you used to be hairy.
What happened?

07:09.369 --> 07:10.873
Things change.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.280
What's up, Barney?
Hey, how you doing?

07:12.409 --> 07:13.753
Jumbo Shrimp around?

07:13.881 --> 07:15.417
Is there a problem?

07:15.577 --> 07:18.265
- My friend wants his ring back.
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.177
Bet's a bet, man.

07:21.305 --> 07:23.129
You know, no offense,
but I'm missing my ring.

07:23.257 --> 07:24.760
It stays where it is.

07:28.697 --> 07:29.881
That's unacceptable.

07:30.425 --> 07:31.833
Striking resemblance.

07:34.073 --> 07:35.353
That's brutal.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.705
- These the guys, Barney?
- Yeah.

07:39.833 --> 07:41.657
Now I see
why they call him Jumbo.

07:41.785 --> 07:44.857
- No, the other guy, second guy.
- Oh.

07:45.497 --> 07:47.993
You lost to Santa's helper?

07:48.121 --> 07:50.393
That's embarrassing.

07:50.521 --> 07:51.577
I was drunk.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.593
Well, you're not drunk now.

07:53.721 --> 07:55.033
Why the fuck am I here?

07:57.177 --> 07:58.361
I hurt my back.

07:58.809 --> 07:59.897
Since when?

08:00.025 --> 08:01.977
A few weeks ago.
I can't even lift a fork.

08:02.105 --> 08:03.769
I would do it for you. But if you
don't want to do it, I understand.

08:03.897 --> 08:04.953
If you're intimidated...

08:05.081 --> 08:06.265
Intimidated?

08:06.617 --> 08:07.705
Hey, Lee.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.593
Make it easy on yourself.

08:10.649 --> 08:11.961
The classics.

08:12.473 --> 08:13.913
I got this, Thumbo.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.089
Beer, please.

08:17.593 --> 08:19.193
How you doing this nice day?

08:22.233 --> 08:25.561
What do you prefer to be called,
"Jumbo" or "Shrimp"?

08:30.905 --> 08:32.345
Call me that again.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.810
Cut your fucking head off.

08:34.937 --> 08:38.361
That's a little harsh,
bite-size.

08:38.489 --> 08:40.249
Barney wants his ring back.

08:40.377 --> 08:41.561
What did you call me?

08:42.265 --> 08:43.833
How much for it back, Yoda?

08:43.961 --> 08:45.241
Hey!

08:45.370 --> 08:47.097
It stays here, asshole.

08:51.897 --> 08:53.241
My back.

08:55.961 --> 08:57.785
You see,

08:57.913 --> 09:00.761
what we have here is a matter of
humiliation and human kindness.

09:00.889 --> 09:04.729
My friend here loves his ring
for all of his stupid reasons.

09:04.857 --> 09:06.361
And it would be very nice
and civilized

09:06.490 --> 09:08.793
if you gents would
understand that principle.

09:08.921 --> 09:10.873
But since you choose to be..

09:12.345 --> 09:13.721
Barney, what's the word?
Obstinate.

09:13.849 --> 09:14.841
Too long.

09:15.577 --> 09:16.569
Dumbbells.

09:17.241 --> 09:18.489
Dumbbells.

09:19.193 --> 09:22.073
You leave me no other choice,
dinky.

09:32.985 --> 09:34.937
- You're welcome.
- You're slowing down.

09:37.113 --> 09:38.425
My turn, bitch.

09:41.721 --> 09:45.113
Come on, chuck.
Come on, cowboy. Bring it.

09:52.857 --> 09:54.681
Get him a beer when he wakes up.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.473
You almost killed me.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.417
I thought you had a bad back.

10:03.545 --> 10:05.753
You know, it's a miracle.
It just went away.

10:05.881 --> 10:09.113
You know, I really didn't need
this lovefest.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.641
I like spending time with you.

10:13.594 --> 10:17.081
Next time,
take me on a pony ride, okay?

10:21.338 --> 10:22.521
Okay.

10:37.977 --> 10:40.313
Overwatch, what is the status?

10:42.458 --> 10:45.274
Sir, there are
three soldiers guarding the general.

10:45.401 --> 10:46.457
<i>You're gonna need backup.</i>

10:46.585 --> 10:48.665
<i>I repeat, wait for backup.</i>

10:53.946 --> 10:55.353
What the fuck is he doing?

10:55.481 --> 10:57.529
No, no, no.
No, no, please. Please, don't.

11:23.865 --> 11:25.849
What's up, General?

11:35.321 --> 11:36.889
Are my eyes deceiving me?
Why?

11:37.018 --> 11:39.994
What's that thing
on Gunner's head?

11:40.121 --> 11:41.818
It looks like a sick cat.

11:42.617 --> 11:44.153
Cats are cute.

11:44.281 --> 11:46.457
That looks like tumbleweed.

11:46.585 --> 11:49.369
Hey, good evening, big man.

11:49.498 --> 11:51.929
Let's talk. What's that
thing on your head?

11:52.761 --> 11:53.785
Oh, the wig?

11:53.913 --> 11:55.961
Yeah, the wig.
Question is, why?

11:56.089 --> 11:57.945
Well, I was chatting
with this girl on the Internet

11:58.073 --> 12:00.122
and she likes
that '70s look, you know.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.241
The Farrah Fawcett thing.

12:01.369 --> 12:03.321
Got it. You met her yet?

12:03.449 --> 12:06.297
Why.. Why would I do that?
I like the mystery.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.089
Understand? Yeah,
that makes sense.

12:08.217 --> 12:09.497
Sounds special.
It does.

12:09.626 --> 12:11.289
I liked him better
when he was a drunk.

12:11.417 --> 12:12.698
I know what you mean.
Me too.

12:12.825 --> 12:14.201
I'm happy for you.

12:18.266 --> 12:19.865
Hey, is this the new guy?

12:20.697 --> 12:22.489
Hey, it's Easy Day.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.345
Good man. Ex-special forces.

12:24.473 --> 12:26.649
- Hey, Barney.
- Hey, Easy.

12:27.385 --> 12:28.922
This our sniper?

12:29.050 --> 12:32.505
Don't worry about it.
I got a prescription scope.

12:32.890 --> 12:34.137
What?

12:34.265 --> 12:35.865
Well, Hawkeyes,
remember this face.

12:35.993 --> 12:37.369
Don't shoot it by accident.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.314
You don't have to worry
about me.

12:40.442 --> 12:41.402
Who's this guy?

12:41.530 --> 12:42.873
You're slipping, pal.

12:43.001 --> 12:44.793
You hired him.
That's Galgo's son.

12:44.921 --> 12:47.929
I have the eyesight, the heart
and the sex drive of my father.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.849
Tell me he doesn't talk
as much as his father.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.161
He's worse.
No.

12:51.289 --> 12:52.313
Twice as bad.

12:52.441 --> 12:54.137
It's gonna be a long trip.

12:54.810 --> 12:56.505
I am Galan.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.682
That suppose to mean something?

13:00.953 --> 13:02.745
It's supposed to mean
a little something.

13:02.873 --> 13:05.306
All right,
cut the bullshit. All eyes on me.

13:05.434 --> 13:06.330
Who's the suit?

13:06.458 --> 13:08.218
His name is Marsh.

13:08.346 --> 13:09.945
I did a few things with him
before I met you.

13:10.074 --> 13:12.825
He's CIA.
Hey, Barney, how you doing?

13:12.954 --> 13:14.042
How you doing, Marsh?

13:14.170 --> 13:15.353
How they hanging?

13:15.962 --> 13:17.241
Gravity's setting in.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.642
Welcome to the club.

13:19.770 --> 13:21.626
As much as I would like to
exchange pleasantries with you guys,

13:21.754 --> 13:23.610
there's a pressing matter
at hand.

13:23.738 --> 13:25.977
Meet Suharato Rahmat.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.217
Former British national
turned arms dealer.

13:28.346 --> 13:29.945
He has his own private army
and he's been hired

13:30.073 --> 13:32.410
to steal some detonators
for nuclear missiles

13:32.537 --> 13:34.106
for a very dangerous client.

13:34.234 --> 13:37.018
Word on the street is
the client's name is Ocelot.

13:37.146 --> 13:38.617
Hmm.

13:38.745 --> 13:40.826
Now, those detonators
get in the hands of Ocelot,

13:40.954 --> 13:43.706
he's planning on using them to
create an international incident.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.658
We can't let that happen.

13:46.586 --> 13:48.825
So that's where
you guys come in.

13:48.953 --> 13:52.153
Your landing zone is Qaddafi's
old chemical war plant in Libya,

13:52.282 --> 13:54.362
which I hear is very nice
this time of year.

13:54.490 --> 13:58.010
Your mission is to make sure
the detonators stay there.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.321
All right?

13:59.449 --> 14:01.018
That's all I got.
Good luck.

14:01.146 --> 14:02.777
Barney, keep 'em tucked.

14:02.906 --> 14:04.281
I'll do my best.

14:06.201 --> 14:09.017
Operation Ocelot.
Mm-hmm.

14:09.145 --> 14:10.778
When were you gonna tell me?

14:10.937 --> 14:13.017
When you stopped playing
footsies with your girlfriend.

14:18.394 --> 14:20.889
Hey, why's Christmas so pissed
about this Ocelot mission?

14:21.018 --> 14:23.898
He's just being Christmas.

14:24.026 --> 14:26.585
- Copy that.
- He knows Barney very well.

14:26.713 --> 14:30.041
He knows exactly how far
he's willing to go to end Ocelot.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.281
Who the hell
names himself Ocelot?

14:32.409 --> 14:34.586
Years ago, the CIA hired Barney

14:34.714 --> 14:37.913
to find out who code
name "Ocelot" actually is.

14:38.041 --> 14:41.370
He was close when somebody
walked him into an ambush

14:41.498 --> 14:43.641
and nearly killed
his entire team.

14:44.122 --> 14:45.338
Damn.

14:45.465 --> 14:47.194
Yeah, some would say
Ocelot's a ghost

14:47.321 --> 14:50.681
that Barney created to cover
his own ass for a mistake.

14:50.810 --> 14:52.090
No fucking way.

14:52.217 --> 14:55.513
Ocelot exists and Barney
will bury him someday.

14:56.602 --> 14:58.650
What the fuck happened
to your ear, man?

14:58.778 --> 15:00.666
I'm glad you asked me that.

15:00.793 --> 15:04.825
I wrestled in college. Common affliction
in that sport is contusions to the ear.

15:04.953 --> 15:08.154
Small pocket of blood that
separates the skin from the cartilage.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.546
Come on, big bird.

15:25.849 --> 15:27.386
Get up there, you deathtrap.

15:27.514 --> 15:29.017
Don't insult it.

15:35.513 --> 15:38.489
We have a successful liftoff.

15:45.113 --> 15:47.257
Maybe it was
my first ménage à trois.

15:47.386 --> 15:50.905
You know. You know, Toll Road,
what I'm talking about, right?

15:52.921 --> 15:53.913
Hey.

15:54.585 --> 15:56.186
You know what is
a golden shower?

15:58.393 --> 15:59.866
It's when the woman, she..

15:59.994 --> 16:02.874
<i>She squats down on top of you
and releases her bladder.</i>

16:03.002 --> 16:04.153
<i>It's very liberating.</i>

16:04.281 --> 16:06.073
Wow, a world-class pervert.

16:06.201 --> 16:07.546
You know what is
a golden shower?

16:07.674 --> 16:09.850
You look like the type
who has had one before.

16:09.977 --> 16:11.578
I'm cutting these losers.

16:11.706 --> 16:15.290
I heard too much of that.
It's tune time. Time for music.

16:17.785 --> 16:18.969
It's ancient.

16:19.386 --> 16:20.282
It's soothing.

16:20.410 --> 16:21.817
Soothing?
Yeah.

16:21.946 --> 16:23.513
Yeah, maybe.

16:24.954 --> 16:26.521
You know I had
a panic attack last night.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.018
Did you really?
Are you sure? Yeah.

16:29.145 --> 16:30.425
Like your skin starts to crawl?

16:30.554 --> 16:32.377
Your heart is beating?
You know it.

16:32.506 --> 16:34.873
Just take some Xanax and
pretend you're happy with your life.

16:35.001 --> 16:36.378
I am happy.

16:37.177 --> 16:39.578
By the way,
you're the worst doctor, ever.

16:40.410 --> 16:42.713
Maybe it's Gina
who's making you anxious.

16:43.481 --> 16:44.761
She actually relaxes me.

16:44.890 --> 16:47.034
It's this.. This.. The job.

16:47.162 --> 16:48.569
No.

16:48.697 --> 16:50.457
Some guys are just not meant
for companionship.

16:50.585 --> 16:52.441
Face the facts.
Wrong.

16:52.570 --> 16:55.193
Maybe you want to die a bitter old sod,
but not me.

16:55.321 --> 16:57.370
I want to be cheerful, happy.

16:58.105 --> 17:01.113
But I will come visit you
in the home.

17:01.242 --> 17:03.354
- Promise?
- Scout's honor.

17:05.178 --> 17:07.162
Let's see what's going on.

17:07.290 --> 17:08.441
<i>One of them was
covering me in hot candle wax.</i>

17:08.569 --> 17:09.689
Forget it.

17:15.706 --> 17:17.113
Where are the detonators?

17:17.241 --> 17:18.458
Never!

17:18.874 --> 17:19.961
Your wife.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.201
Not my wife.
No, <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

17:23.610 --> 17:24.761
Your son is next.

17:24.889 --> 17:27.322
P-Please, not my son.
Please.

17:27.450 --> 17:29.370
Give me the detonators,
and I'll make it quick.

17:29.498 --> 17:30.681
My son, Adam...

17:30.809 --> 17:32.473
This is a fact
you cannot change.

17:32.601 --> 17:34.425
Give me the detonators or...

17:34.553 --> 17:35.641
Not my son.

17:35.770 --> 17:36.794
Your choice.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.106
Okay. Okay.

17:38.714 --> 17:40.185
They are in control room.

17:40.313 --> 17:42.201
The code to the safe is...

17:43.706 --> 17:44.890
eight,

17:45.049 --> 17:46.105
one,

17:46.233 --> 17:47.161
four,

17:47.290 --> 17:48.282
two...

17:48.889 --> 17:50.106
seven.

17:50.234 --> 17:51.897
Wise choice.

17:54.042 --> 17:55.769
Let's wake up the kids.

17:56.378 --> 17:57.753
Ready?
Yep.

18:04.058 --> 18:05.562
♪ <i>East side</i> ♪

18:05.690 --> 18:07.418
♪ <i>West</i> ♪
♪ <i>Side</i> ♪

18:16.825 --> 18:17.978
Where'd that come from?

18:18.649 --> 18:20.186
Ah, this is gonna be fun.

18:20.314 --> 18:22.714
- <i>LZ's hot.</i>
- Here we go.

18:24.569 --> 18:26.457
- Incoming!
- Flak!

18:31.898 --> 18:32.794
<i>Intel was off.</i>

18:32.921 --> 18:34.137
Get creative!

18:34.266 --> 18:35.386
Got it.

18:36.602 --> 18:37.849
Touch and go.

18:37.977 --> 18:39.386
Okay, rally up. Rally up.

18:39.514 --> 18:40.793
Am I driving lead?
Nah.

18:40.922 --> 18:42.649
Take Gunner to overwatch
and fall in.

18:49.882 --> 18:51.225
Touch!

18:58.490 --> 18:59.482
Happy hunting.

19:03.833 --> 19:06.713
Check it out. There's something
happening at the weapons plant.

19:06.842 --> 19:07.930
We're on it.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.034
<i>I count four
vehicles and a lot of ops.</i>

19:15.161 --> 19:16.858
Well, let's make less of them.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.042
Sir, I have a new transport.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.162
Excellent.

19:27.897 --> 19:29.306
Tell Ocelot we have them.

19:30.106 --> 19:31.098
Let's go.

19:34.906 --> 19:36.058
In position.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.265
Load up!

19:38.393 --> 19:39.546
<i>Rahmat's got the detonators.</i>

19:39.674 --> 19:41.018
Gunner, you got eyes on them?

19:41.145 --> 19:43.386
Like crystal in headlights.

19:49.274 --> 19:51.034
Gunner, you're way off target.

19:51.162 --> 19:52.506
What do you need,
a seeing-eye dog?

19:52.633 --> 19:54.521
Damn spots.

19:57.178 --> 20:00.281
Hey, Stevie Wonder, you might
want to get that prescription checked.

20:03.610 --> 20:05.209
<i>Heads up.</i>
<i>Lee, where are you?</i>

20:05.338 --> 20:07.097
Looks like we're making
our entrance.

20:07.226 --> 20:08.730
Hold on to your <i>huevos.</i>

20:09.242 --> 20:11.194
Let's fly, baby!

20:19.450 --> 20:20.633
Whoo-hoo!

20:24.794 --> 20:26.265
Who the fuck is this now?

20:26.393 --> 20:28.378
<i>What do we do,
boss?</i>

20:29.562 --> 20:30.522
Kill them.

20:31.001 --> 20:32.186
Open fire!

20:42.170 --> 20:44.058
Gunner, we could use some help!

20:48.250 --> 20:49.498
Six months sober.

20:57.434 --> 20:59.450
Now that's
what I'm talking about, Gunner.

21:01.849 --> 21:03.162
Can you lose them?

21:12.826 --> 21:14.458
- We're inside!
- Copy.

21:16.826 --> 21:18.073
Split up.

21:19.065 --> 21:20.186
Galan, we'll take point.

21:20.314 --> 21:22.937
- You go after that squirter.
- Copy.

21:33.114 --> 21:34.170
Ooh.

21:35.385 --> 21:36.858
We lost the .50 cal.

21:50.681 --> 21:51.866
Pull up alongside him.

21:54.394 --> 21:55.322
Time to improvise.

21:55.450 --> 21:56.730
I can improvise.

22:10.042 --> 22:11.865
Gut shot. You'll live.

22:18.266 --> 22:19.290
Whoa.

22:19.418 --> 22:20.634
Maybe not.

22:29.562 --> 22:31.322
Galan,
what the fuck are you doing?

22:31.770 --> 22:32.890
I'm improvising.

22:44.473 --> 22:47.002
What's going on in there?
I need a status report now!

22:49.114 --> 22:51.161
One more and we're on Rahmat.

23:04.698 --> 23:06.042
What the fuck, Easy?

23:09.210 --> 23:10.810
Only easy day was yesterday.

23:10.938 --> 23:11.866
Yep.

23:15.802 --> 23:18.490
Initial success
or total failure?

23:26.778 --> 23:28.538
Initial success.

23:28.666 --> 23:31.194
I'm out of ammo.
I'm coming in.

23:38.426 --> 23:39.770
You mean total failure.

23:45.818 --> 23:48.570
Christmas, where are you?
The detonators are compromised.

23:48.698 --> 23:50.842
<i>They're on the west side
heading north.</i>

23:53.306 --> 23:55.098
Don't let Rahmat leave
with those detonators

23:55.226 --> 23:57.562
or there's gonna be
a lot of dead people.

24:01.306 --> 24:02.810
Get in, losers!
We're going shopping!

24:02.938 --> 24:04.826
You might want
to watch your six!

24:07.770 --> 24:09.114
Fire in the hole, fellas!

24:10.009 --> 24:11.354
Moving!

24:13.849 --> 24:15.194
Cover me!

24:15.738 --> 24:16.954
Incoming!

24:18.554 --> 24:21.402
Don't worry, my friend.
I would never leave you behind.

24:54.202 --> 24:55.578
I can't get the angle!

25:03.450 --> 25:05.882
<i>I'm out of flares.</i>
Damn it, Barney!

25:07.546 --> 25:09.339
Stay on mission, Christmas.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.778
You're toast up there.

25:10.906 --> 25:12.762
Listen to him, man.
Get the detonators.

25:12.890 --> 25:15.034
<i>Get the detonators, Lee!</i>

25:15.162 --> 25:16.538
That's an order!

25:18.618 --> 25:21.049
Fuck no.
I'm saving your dumb ass!

25:40.154 --> 25:41.466
You're welcome!

25:41.594 --> 25:44.410
Nice work, man,
but who's on Rahmat?

26:50.394 --> 26:51.578
Holy shit.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.106
I miss him, man.

27:21.018 --> 27:23.929
♪ <i>All our times have come... ♪</i>

27:24.058 --> 27:27.098

Everybody listen up.

27:43.002 --> 27:44.922
There's an old expression.

27:45.787 --> 27:47.130
Beware an old man

27:47.258 --> 27:49.306
in a profession
where good men die young.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.483
I'm sure Barney Ross has
had a seat reserved

27:51.611 --> 27:54.266
at the big table up there
for some time now.

27:54.395 --> 27:56.122
And he earned that seat.

27:56.251 --> 27:58.171
He never stopped earning it.

27:58.299 --> 28:02.329
He brought the best out in each and every
one of us because he was the best of us.

28:04.955 --> 28:06.202
To Barney.

28:06.330 --> 28:07.707
To Barney.

28:17.371 --> 28:18.714
How are you?

28:19.355 --> 28:20.794
Great.

28:22.906 --> 28:24.762
You don't gotta pretend, Lee.

28:24.890 --> 28:28.249
You know Barney wouldn't
want to watch you sulking like this.

28:29.019 --> 28:30.202
It's true.

28:31.450 --> 28:32.442
Can I help?

28:35.898 --> 28:38.138
Well, since you're asking...

28:39.355 --> 28:40.347
I'd like..

28:43.162 --> 28:45.115
So when are we going
after the guys that did this?

28:45.243 --> 28:47.834
You ain't going nowhere.
You're done.

28:51.322 --> 28:52.858
What's that mean?
You're off it.

28:52.987 --> 28:55.066
- You're done. You're out.
- Bullshit, Marsh.

28:55.194 --> 28:56.986
Who's gonna run Barney's team?

29:01.370 --> 29:02.362
Gina?

29:05.786 --> 29:07.419
What is this, a bad joke?

29:07.546 --> 29:09.339
Well, you disobeyed a
direct order from your superior

29:09.466 --> 29:11.674
and that cost us the mission,
so you're out.

29:11.802 --> 29:13.883
- I was trying to save him.
- Well, you didn't.

29:14.011 --> 29:16.538
It's our play, it's our call.
You're out.

29:17.787 --> 29:20.410
It was Barney's
sacrifice to make, brother.

29:20.538 --> 29:23.194
Good death for the mission,
it would count.

29:23.322 --> 29:24.986
And you just took it from him.

29:25.114 --> 29:27.674
Made his sacrifice worthless.

29:33.978 --> 29:35.067
Christmas.

29:37.147 --> 29:38.329
Yeah.

29:41.274 --> 29:42.586
Thanks for the support.

29:45.595 --> 29:48.090
You certainly picked
your moment, pal.

30:02.618 --> 30:03.610
Oh.

30:04.218 --> 30:06.266
Barney hated cover bands.

30:07.162 --> 30:08.667
I'll be in touch.

30:09.658 --> 30:10.618
Hey.

30:12.922 --> 30:14.491
Nothing Barney did
was worthless.

30:14.619 --> 30:16.794
- You understand? Nothing!
- Hey. Easy, cowboy.

30:16.922 --> 30:18.267
Fuck you,
talking about Barney in my face.

30:18.395 --> 30:20.187
This
ain't the place or time.

30:20.347 --> 30:23.610
<i>Por favor.</i> Please,
please. <i>Tranquilo.</i>

30:41.531 --> 30:43.227
Pantry cook.

30:45.562 --> 30:47.418
Hospitality director.

30:48.123 --> 30:50.202
Can be "hospitable-ish."

30:52.731 --> 30:57.114
Private security detail
for a social media influencer.

31:06.649 --> 31:08.858
I'm gonna go get a drink.

31:08.987 --> 31:10.426
We're about to go live.

31:10.554 --> 31:12.187
We're about to stream this shit,

31:12.314 --> 31:15.322
and you girls look like shit.

31:15.450 --> 31:17.755
Uh, no. No.

31:17.883 --> 31:19.611
Buh-bye.

31:19.738 --> 31:23.034
Hey,
muscles. Get over here.

31:28.411 --> 31:30.554
Here, dude.
Hold my sign.

31:31.898 --> 31:33.498
Whoo!

31:33.626 --> 31:36.538
I'm your
private security detail.

31:36.666 --> 31:38.298
I'm here to protect you.

31:38.875 --> 31:39.898
Not hold your sign.

31:40.987 --> 31:44.089
You see anybody
looking to do me harm?

31:44.218 --> 31:46.138
Potentially.

31:46.266 --> 31:48.826
Whatever.
Just hold the sign.

31:49.498 --> 31:51.769
"Potentially."
Double-O douchebag.

31:56.027 --> 31:58.203
What's up, motherfuckers?

31:58.331 --> 32:00.282
I'm here at my NOLA pad

32:00.409 --> 32:02.266
live streaming to you at home.

32:02.394 --> 32:03.771
Bringing a little
something-something

32:03.898 --> 32:06.202
into your pathetic little lives.

32:06.330 --> 32:08.314
Look at these NOLA bitches.

32:08.443 --> 32:13.307
Which one.. No, which two
am I gonna fuck after?

32:13.435 --> 32:16.283
Oi. Have
some respect for the ladies.

32:16.411 --> 32:18.203
I am live streaming here.

32:18.331 --> 32:20.569
You guys believe this shit?
Look at this guy.

32:20.698 --> 32:22.939
Who does this motherfucker
think he is?

32:23.067 --> 32:25.211
"Oi, respect the ladies."

32:25.338 --> 32:27.099
I'll respect them all right.

32:27.226 --> 32:29.178
Respect them enough to let
them lick the sweat off my balls.

32:31.675 --> 32:33.210
Fuck, dude, my nose.

32:34.266 --> 32:38.042
Do you know how much money
I make off this face, asshole?

33:04.698 --> 33:06.522
Fuck it.

34:08.954 --> 34:11.547
Welcome home, love.

34:12.443 --> 34:13.914
You're lucky I didn't shoot you.

34:14.042 --> 34:17.275
Probably.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.131
Hey, do you read now?

34:19.546 --> 34:20.923
What is this?

34:22.362 --> 34:23.803
Going somewhere, are we?

34:23.931 --> 34:26.362
We're going after the guy
that got Barney.

34:29.019 --> 34:32.346
The only good thing that came out of Barney's
death was the unsealing of that file.

34:32.475 --> 34:34.969
What the fuck does that
mean? What's in here?

34:35.547 --> 34:37.050
Well,

34:37.179 --> 34:39.099
Barney was part of
a classified operation

34:39.227 --> 34:41.243
in between
international agencies.

34:41.371 --> 34:45.339
And when it went south, all the parties
involved decided to seal the file

34:45.466 --> 34:48.091
until everyone
associated with it was dead.

34:48.219 --> 34:51.354
So once Barney passed,
that file was declassified.

34:51.483 --> 34:54.395
It gave us a vital clue
on Ocelot's identity.

34:57.243 --> 34:59.643
I want in.
I'm coming with you.

34:59.771 --> 35:01.115
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:02.010 --> 35:03.834
You weren't invited.

35:03.963 --> 35:05.115
Oh.

35:05.243 --> 35:07.482
Well, won't you be lonely
without me?

35:08.283 --> 35:09.562
No.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.643
There's lots of other boys
on the mission.

35:11.771 --> 35:12.763
Oh.

35:15.035 --> 35:16.571
I'm not in the mood.

35:16.699 --> 35:18.971
I'm gonna play a little Hendrix.

35:19.098 --> 35:21.211
Usually does the trick.
Don't start.

35:21.339 --> 35:23.259
Oh, I'm starting.

35:26.363 --> 35:28.794
Oh, I always liked this tattoo.

35:28.923 --> 35:30.746
So did your brother.

35:38.459 --> 35:40.443
This was always my favorite seat
in the house.

35:40.571 --> 35:43.129
Well, these and the cheap seats.

35:50.171 --> 35:52.411
You really need to
be more careful. Mmm.

35:52.539 --> 35:53.786
Make me.

36:00.155 --> 36:02.362
Do an old soldier a favor.

36:04.346 --> 36:06.074
First things first.

36:24.666 --> 36:26.619
When I first met Barney...

36:28.411 --> 36:30.169
I was straight out of the SAS.

36:32.251 --> 36:34.395
Nothing to my name,
down on my luck.

36:39.418 --> 36:42.267
He took a chance on me
when no one else would.

36:46.683 --> 36:49.402
We're gonna get the guy
that did this to Barney.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.242
I promise.

36:58.203 --> 37:00.315
I know I can't go with you.

37:03.131 --> 37:04.859
But I want you to take this.

37:12.827 --> 37:13.659
Well,

37:14.651 --> 37:17.178
I'll make sure
to give Rahmat your regards.

37:58.426 --> 37:59.739
You catch any of that?

37:59.867 --> 38:01.787
I don't know what she's saying.

38:01.915 --> 38:04.603
- But why do you think they call her Lash?
- I have no idea.

38:04.731 --> 38:07.707
But I'd love to find out.
She can lash me anytime.

38:08.795 --> 38:10.906
Oh, it's way bigger
than that, darling.

38:11.035 --> 38:12.635
No, no.
That's the Chinese bird.

38:12.762 --> 38:15.035
- We use the middle finger, they use the pinky.
- Oh.

38:15.163 --> 38:17.946
But if the shoe fits...

38:18.715 --> 38:20.283
I was saying
what's up with your ears?

38:20.411 --> 38:21.755
- My ear?
- Oh, shit.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.995
Well, everybody knows
I wrestled in college.

38:24.123 --> 38:27.579
And a common affliction in that sport
is that you get a contusion in the ear

38:27.707 --> 38:30.971
that separates the cartilage from
the skin and creates a little pocket.

38:31.099 --> 38:32.731
I've had this one
drained nine times.

38:32.859 --> 38:34.459
I've never seen him so quiet.

38:34.587 --> 38:36.443
In essence, God gave me armor.

38:36.571 --> 38:39.195
He hasn't said
anything since Barney died.

38:39.323 --> 38:42.203
Now, I caught my
roommate talking shit about it one time.

38:42.331 --> 38:45.499
And I had to smack him upside his head
and give him his own cauliflower ear.

38:45.627 --> 38:46.811
That's just the way it goes.

38:46.939 --> 38:49.403
You want to feel it? No?

38:49.531 --> 38:51.259
It's not contagious.
I promise.

39:32.507 --> 39:34.523
I'm looking for Decha.

39:38.811 --> 39:39.643
Who?

39:40.571 --> 39:42.683
Ex-Task Force 90.
Thailand Special Forces.

39:42.811 --> 39:45.179
Supposedly owns a boat
that docks around here.

39:47.067 --> 39:48.955
Don't know anyone around here
like that.

39:49.083 --> 39:51.195
But if he have boat,

39:51.963 --> 39:55.131
boat down there, not up here.

39:57.530 --> 39:58.875
Thanks for your help.

40:35.739 --> 40:37.531
Hey, excuse me, friend.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.091
You know the owner of this boat?

40:41.532 --> 40:43.675
I'm looking
for a man named Decha.

40:45.499 --> 40:47.995
I'm sorry.
Decha has long gone.

40:48.123 --> 40:49.915
Oh, yeah? Where?

40:50.843 --> 40:54.139
To a place of peace.

40:54.715 --> 40:55.707
Dead?

40:56.507 --> 40:57.499
Ah.

40:58.363 --> 41:01.467
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of that going around.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.139
Excuse me.

41:06.267 --> 41:08.987
I can't let you
steal this boat, Sir.

41:10.075 --> 41:11.419
What's it to you?

41:13.723 --> 41:15.163
Just a boat.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.339
It's not yours.

41:19.835 --> 41:23.803
Hey, listen, I'm taking this boat
with or without your permission.

41:28.923 --> 41:30.939
Why do you have Barney's ring?

41:32.283 --> 41:33.627
Barney's dead.

41:35.067 --> 41:38.075
And I need this boat to get
to the people who killed him.

41:38.203 --> 41:39.995
I was looking for Decha.

41:40.123 --> 41:43.067
From what Barney said about the man,
I could use him for what's ahead.

41:43.195 --> 41:44.635
Barney's dead.

41:48.379 --> 41:50.747
I was once Decha,
the man you seek.

41:51.355 --> 41:53.243
But I put that man behind me.

41:53.371 --> 41:55.452
If what you say is true,

41:55.579 --> 41:58.043
Barney should have his revenge.

41:58.171 --> 41:59.835
Damn right, he should.

42:08.987 --> 42:10.171
Hey.

42:17.595 --> 42:19.163
Okay, listen up.

42:20.251 --> 42:22.875
The Thai cargo ship <i>Jintara</i>
was hijacked

42:23.003 --> 42:25.307
in the Andaman Sea
by our mutual friend Rahmat.

42:25.435 --> 42:27.132
The <i>Jintara</i> has changed course

42:27.259 --> 42:30.619
and is tracking en route to the
Russian coast of Vladivostok.

42:30.747 --> 42:33.531
Now, due to that royal
clusterfuck that was Libya,

42:33.658 --> 42:36.411
Rahmat has taken possession
of the nuclear detonators.

42:36.538 --> 42:38.524
The ship itself
is gonna be hosting an exchange

42:38.652 --> 42:41.563
where they'll be taking possession
of the remaining nuclear materials

42:41.690 --> 42:43.995
needed to construct
a viable bomb, nuclear type.

42:44.123 --> 42:46.619
And we cannot let that happen.
Understood?

42:46.746 --> 42:48.795
Now,
we also have valuable intel that says

42:48.923 --> 42:51.132
that Ocelot will be
on the <i>Jintara.</i>

42:51.290 --> 42:55.099
So this might be our one and only
chance to learn of his true identity.

42:55.227 --> 42:57.115
- Or her.
- What's that?

42:57.852 --> 42:59.099
Could be a her.

43:00.636 --> 43:01.915
Or her identity, yes.

43:02.043 --> 43:03.484
And bring him or her in.

43:03.612 --> 43:05.915
As you know, Barney's death
opened up a file

43:06.043 --> 43:08.412
that reveals the name of a
man who worked with Ocelot.

43:08.539 --> 43:10.395
A witness in witness protection.

43:10.523 --> 43:12.315
More on him from Russo.

43:13.084 --> 43:14.907
Name's Phen Lyong Bai.

43:15.036 --> 43:18.075
Ocelot's former partner
who'd love to rat Ocelot out.

43:18.203 --> 43:19.515
Snitches get stitches.
Right, Gunner?

43:19.643 --> 43:21.435
That's right.
Snitches get stitches.

43:21.563 --> 43:24.123
I don't have to tell you
how sensitive this mission is.

43:24.251 --> 43:28.763
If the Russians get wind that
the US forces are not only near

43:28.891 --> 43:30.492
but inside Russian territory,

43:30.619 --> 43:32.316
it's a World War III shit show.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.300
Understood?

43:34.427 --> 43:36.315
So that's why this mission carries
no US signature whatsoever.

43:36.443 --> 43:38.012
Full deniability.

43:38.140 --> 43:40.347
If this goes bad, it's on you.
And one last thing.

43:40.475 --> 43:43.963
Since you Neanderthals dicked up
that last mission in Libya without me,

43:44.090 --> 43:47.291
I'm gonna be coming along
to babysit you this time.

43:47.419 --> 43:50.106
Now, won't that be fun?
Gina.

43:51.066 --> 43:53.563
All right, so the mission's
gonna go down like this.

43:53.690 --> 43:57.147
We're gonna run this assault as a
split team with two separate objectives.

43:57.276 --> 43:58.490
We're gonna HALO in.

43:58.619 --> 43:59.835
Team Alpha's
gonna secure the bridge

43:59.963 --> 44:01.755
while Bravo searches
and sweeps the boat.

44:01.883 --> 44:04.379
We're gonna identify,
kill-capture both Ocelot and Rahmat,

44:04.506 --> 44:08.346
secure the detonators and the
nuclear components, helo extract.

44:08.475 --> 44:09.947
Any questions?

44:12.827 --> 44:15.452
Is my delivery a little
different than Barney's?

44:15.580 --> 44:18.043
He probably would have just said,
"Let's go."

44:18.171 --> 44:19.228
Yeah.

44:19.356 --> 44:20.570
Well...

44:21.179 --> 44:22.427
let's go.

44:29.595 --> 44:31.067
Is that an axe?

44:31.963 --> 44:33.531
No, it's a snow shovel.

44:34.652 --> 44:37.915
That makes sense. Not for humanity,
but for you it makes sense.

44:43.739 --> 44:45.819
Hey. So what's your story?

44:46.843 --> 44:49.851
Barney told me
you were ex-Task Force 90.

44:49.979 --> 44:51.643
Ultimate killer type.

44:51.771 --> 44:54.203
Never seen anyone faster
or better.

44:55.804 --> 44:59.995
There's only so many times
you can kill a man, Christmas.

45:00.539 --> 45:02.299
Each time,

45:02.428 --> 45:04.251
it gets easier.

45:04.379 --> 45:09.659
You become numb to pain,
to joy, and to love.

45:11.450 --> 45:13.563
With every person you kill,

45:14.363 --> 45:17.083
you lose
a little more of yourself.

45:18.299 --> 45:21.628
I had to stop
before there was nothing left.

46:38.267 --> 46:40.635
Figured I'd be
using my axe by now.

46:45.595 --> 46:47.450
This is too quiet.
Something ain't right.

46:47.579 --> 46:51.483
Easy Day, Lash, you're with me. The
rest of you, swing around port quarter.

46:51.611 --> 46:53.628
Where's port quarter again?

46:53.756 --> 46:57.147
I was Army. We said left and right,
not port and starship shit.

46:57.275 --> 46:58.939
Starboard is right.

46:59.899 --> 47:01.755
Port, left. Quarter, back.

47:01.883 --> 47:03.388
Got it. Let's move.

47:35.036 --> 47:37.084
Got a bad feeling about this.

47:37.212 --> 47:39.387
Yeah,
where the hell is everybody?

47:39.515 --> 47:41.692
The nuke is definitely
onboard.

47:44.219 --> 47:45.852
<i>All right, listen up.</i>
<i>Bad news.</i>

47:45.979 --> 47:48.348
<i>They already have uranium
with the detonators.</i>

47:48.476 --> 47:52.091
<i>There is now an active
nuclear bomb on the ship.</i>

47:53.500 --> 47:55.132
We're about to take the bridge.

48:06.075 --> 48:07.644
It's a ghost town in here.

48:08.315 --> 48:10.299
Go!
Put your weapons down now!

48:15.580 --> 48:17.979
What a fucking mess
this turned out to be.

48:18.587 --> 48:19.931
First Libya, now this.

48:20.060 --> 48:22.139
Somebody knew we were coming.
Both times.

48:22.268 --> 48:23.579
My intel was solid.

48:23.706 --> 48:25.435
- Your intel was shit.
- Ah, shit on this.

48:25.563 --> 48:26.908
The intel
could have been leaked.

48:27.036 --> 48:29.307
- We don't know you.
- He was verified.

48:29.435 --> 48:31.386
Well, then maybe it was
your new girlfriend.

48:31.516 --> 48:32.923
Fuck you, Gunner.

48:33.050 --> 48:35.612
You sold us out in Vilena
on that mission.

48:35.740 --> 48:37.468
Think I'd forget about that?

48:37.596 --> 48:39.643
Somebody did sell us out.

48:40.284 --> 48:41.468
How about your man?

48:41.595 --> 48:43.610
You sold him out
so you could be on top.

48:43.739 --> 48:45.372
Back off.
She wouldn't do that.

48:45.499 --> 48:47.292
What? Fuck him on top?

48:47.419 --> 48:48.666
Fuck you.

48:48.796 --> 48:50.363
Maybe it's the mute
over in the corner.

48:50.491 --> 48:52.988
What's up, Galan?
Cat got your tongue, cowboy?

48:53.115 --> 48:55.420
Yeah,
he's hiding something. Yeah.

48:55.548 --> 48:58.107
I never trusted this fucking guy.

49:09.148 --> 49:11.547
- Who's the leader?
- I'm the leader.

49:30.332 --> 49:31.483
Take him.

49:48.827 --> 49:50.075
Fuck.

49:51.388 --> 49:52.827
There she is.

49:55.259 --> 49:56.763
Go time.

50:01.148 --> 50:02.844
I'll go first.

50:02.972 --> 50:04.700
Send down a signal when
it's clear for you to follow.

50:04.828 --> 50:06.524
This is as far as I go.

50:07.612 --> 50:10.203
- I could use you.
- I can't.

50:10.843 --> 50:13.116
If I let the old me out,

50:13.244 --> 50:16.795
I don't know if I could ever
get him back in.

50:22.204 --> 50:23.419
I understand.

51:19.868 --> 51:21.628
Should be carnage up here.

51:22.619 --> 51:24.027
Where are you guys?

51:25.979 --> 51:27.964
My shift's done.
Going downstairs.

51:43.932 --> 51:45.947
Don't move and turn around.

51:46.396 --> 51:47.227
Slowly.

51:47.356 --> 51:48.890
Well, which one is it, friend?

51:49.020 --> 51:51.867
Don't move
or turn around slowly?

51:52.572 --> 51:53.980
Turn around.

51:54.108 --> 51:55.100
Very slowly.

52:00.028 --> 52:01.852
Ah! Jesus Christ!

52:01.979 --> 52:04.764
Colin, you scared the shit out of me,
you bellend.

52:04.892 --> 52:06.684
Colin?
Who the fuck is Colin?

52:06.812 --> 52:09.979
Don't give me that. Hey,
you need to be careful with that.

52:10.108 --> 52:12.220
That could go off in your hand.

52:25.370 --> 52:26.939
Perfect timing,
Mr. Marsh.

52:30.876 --> 52:31.739
<i>Marsh?</i>

52:31.868 --> 52:33.532
This mission was a trap.

52:33.659 --> 52:35.420
Somebody leaked our intel.

52:39.900 --> 52:41.563
<i>My demands are simple.</i>

52:42.299 --> 52:43.804
<i>Prisoner exchange.</i>

52:43.932 --> 52:46.652
<i>I want your prisoner,
Phen Lyong Bai.</i>

52:46.780 --> 52:48.892
A dear friend of a friend.

52:49.019 --> 52:50.012
If not,

52:51.004 --> 52:54.139
Mr. Marsh will be the example
of how deadly serious I am.

52:54.268 --> 52:57.307
So, what's it going to be,
Russo?

52:57.436 --> 52:59.835
I don't have the authority.

52:59.963 --> 53:01.404
I know you don't!

53:02.107 --> 53:05.212
But I know someone who does.

53:16.828 --> 53:19.356
Let's get the last
of the fake planes up.

53:20.892 --> 53:24.124
♪ <i>And the rocket's</i>
<i>Red glare</i> ♪

53:24.252 --> 53:27.643
♪ <i>The bombs bursting in air</i> ♪

53:38.748 --> 53:39.899
Rahmat,

53:40.507 --> 53:42.492
you sneaky little sausage.

53:48.092 --> 53:49.404
I can get you the authority.

53:49.532 --> 53:51.675
<i>Phen Lyong Bai
is in your lockup.</i>

53:51.804 --> 53:57.884
<i>Your contact is Donald Allman,
authorization 2-2-5-7-9.</i>

53:58.940 --> 53:59.900
<i>Good.</i>

54:00.028 --> 54:01.275
<i>And no funny business.</i>

54:01.404 --> 54:02.844
It's your call
whether the Expendables

54:02.972 --> 54:05.564
need to live up
to their namesake or not.

54:53.532 --> 54:55.260
<i>Bringing a little</i>
<i>something-something</i>

54:55.387 --> 54:57.532
<i>into your pathetic little lives.</i>

54:57.659 --> 54:59.772
<i>Look at these bitches.</i>

54:59.900 --> 55:04.603
<i>Which one.. No, which two
am I gonna fuck after?</i>

55:04.731 --> 55:07.228
<i>Oi. Have
some respect for the ladies.</i>

55:07.356 --> 55:09.340
<i>I am live streaming here.</i>

55:09.468 --> 55:11.580
<i>You guys believe this shit?
Look at this guy.</i>

55:15.772 --> 55:16.796
<i>"...the ladies."</i>

55:16.924 --> 55:18.268
<i>I'll respect them all right.</i>

55:18.396 --> 55:19.324
<i>Respect them enough
to let them lick</i>

55:19.452 --> 55:20.508
<i>the sweat off my balls.</i>

55:44.252 --> 55:47.803
Huh.
This doesn't belong to you.

55:50.748 --> 55:52.060
Where are my friends?

55:55.100 --> 55:57.340
Where are my friends?
Mm-mmm.

55:57.468 --> 55:59.228
Sir, we might have a problem.

55:59.355 --> 56:01.660
Paithoon and Takk
have gone dark.

56:04.155 --> 56:06.236
Room 657, B-deck.

56:06.364 --> 56:07.995
Much appreciated.

56:09.436 --> 56:10.428
Ah.

56:12.764 --> 56:14.332
Gunner.

56:14.459 --> 56:16.924
<i>Takk?</i>
Don't mind if I do.

56:17.052 --> 56:20.444
<i>Report back, Takk.
We may have a rat onboard.</i>

56:20.571 --> 56:22.652
<i>Check everyone's status.</i>

56:23.580 --> 56:24.796
<i>Takk?</i>

56:24.924 --> 56:26.876
Takk can't come
to the phone right now.

56:28.155 --> 56:29.500
He's a little limp.

56:32.156 --> 56:34.076
Who is this?

56:34.204 --> 56:36.891
<i>A man who made a mistake
letting you live.</i>

56:37.020 --> 56:39.804
- But I'm here to remedy that.
<i>- Ah.</i>

56:39.932 --> 56:42.524
Look who's still
trying to be a hero.

56:42.651 --> 56:44.796
<i>How nice of you to come aboard.</i>

56:44.924 --> 56:48.284
<i>If you're hoping for a redo of the mess
in Libya, you're too late, I'm afraid.</i>

56:48.411 --> 56:50.268
My men are on their way
to hunt you down.

56:50.396 --> 56:54.332
<i>So I guess it's up to me
to put you in an early grave.</i>

56:55.100 --> 56:57.884
Just like I did your friend
in Libya.

56:59.227 --> 57:01.468
Correction.
He wasn't my friend.

57:02.012 --> 57:03.419
He was my brother.

57:03.548 --> 57:04.987
So you can bring your army.

57:05.116 --> 57:06.972
<i>Bring all the fucking men
you want</i>

57:07.100 --> 57:08.636
<i>and I'll work through
every last one of them.</i>

57:08.764 --> 57:10.460
<i>When I get to you,</i>

57:10.588 --> 57:12.540
I'll make sure that the
only way you leave this ship

57:12.667 --> 57:15.452
is in a wonderful variety
of pieces.

57:56.349 --> 57:58.076
Don't shoot by the bomb!

59:01.948 --> 59:04.379
Pavel, you have eyes on the rat?

59:05.628 --> 59:06.844
<i>Yes, Sir.</i> Location?

59:06.972 --> 59:08.636
<i>Corridor, deck one.</i>

59:14.331 --> 59:15.836
<i>Deck two.</i>
What?

59:31.036 --> 59:33.435
<i>Officers' dining area,</i>
<i>deck three.</i>

01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:11.900
Rubber side down, mate.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.477
He's on the stern.

01:02:13.661 --> 01:02:14.940
What are you doing?

01:02:15.067 --> 01:02:16.924
Thought you were done
with this life.

01:02:17.116 --> 01:02:20.860
It would be disrespectful to
Barney's memory to let his friend die.

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:23.261
I like the look.

01:02:23.388 --> 01:02:24.572
Thank you.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.228
- Then let's get to it.
- Okay.

01:02:50.716 --> 01:02:52.476
Everything's sealed tight
down here.

01:02:52.604 --> 01:02:54.204
Yeah,
these are welded up solid too.

01:02:54.332 --> 01:02:55.484
Okay, so what's next?

01:02:55.613 --> 01:02:57.020
Bilge system.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:58.940
What?
Bilge system.

01:02:59.068 --> 01:03:02.429
In emergencies, it clears
water from the ship's dry areas.

01:03:02.557 --> 01:03:04.413
If you get it open,
it should let us out of here.

01:03:04.541 --> 01:03:07.036
Come on,
man. Let's get this fucking thing open.

01:03:07.164 --> 01:03:09.021
Damn it.

01:03:11.293 --> 01:03:14.045
- Well, that ain't budging.
- No shit. It's got to get wet.

01:03:14.173 --> 01:03:15.420
What?

01:03:15.547 --> 01:03:17.404
Wet. If it gets wet,
it'll open.

01:03:18.492 --> 01:03:21.340
- Well, anybody gotta pee?
- I gotta go.

01:03:21.469 --> 01:03:24.477
I've had to piss
since we HALO'd in here.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.747
A little privacy, please?

01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:45.564
The hyoid bone.

01:03:47.004 --> 01:03:50.557
It's the only bone in the human
body not connected to any others.

01:03:51.644 --> 01:03:54.940
It's right here in the throat.
Without it, we cannot speak.

01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:57.981
With these hands,
I will claw the hyoid bone

01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:59.901
from the throat
of that fucker Rahmat,

01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:01.596
stick it up
his boyfriend's <i>culo,</i>

01:04:01.725 --> 01:04:03.420
then make both
of their asses apologize

01:04:03.547 --> 01:04:05.724
while they drown
in their own blood.

01:04:05.853 --> 01:04:07.869
Barney was my hero.

01:04:07.995 --> 01:04:09.757
I do not speak, I cannot speak,

01:04:09.884 --> 01:04:14.044
because my mind is full of these brutal,
visceral fantasies,

01:04:14.172 --> 01:04:17.980
fantasies that will now
become a hellish reality.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.004
You should go back
to not talking.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.853
- Done.
- Any takers?

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.116
This will lead us to the
men who killed Barney?

01:04:37.629 --> 01:04:39.324
Uh, yes.

01:04:39.453 --> 01:04:40.796
I will avenge him.

01:04:46.973 --> 01:04:49.371
Guess he does
like golden showers.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.764
Lyong Bai is en route to you
as we speak.

01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:56.733
<i>I expect to have my team
returned alive.</i>

01:04:56.861 --> 01:04:59.421
Of course. For what is
a man without his word?

01:04:59.549 --> 01:05:02.141
Prepare for exchange.

01:05:02.525 --> 01:05:03.708
Moving out!

01:05:04.892 --> 01:05:06.973
- This way.
- Okay.

01:05:07.101 --> 01:05:09.404
Your friends will be really
happy to see you, right?

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:10.813
Probably not.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:13.020
Gina will have to admit
she needs me.

01:05:13.149 --> 01:05:14.109
On three.
Yeah.

01:05:14.235 --> 01:05:15.420
Three.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:18.749
Nobody here.

01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:20.124
No shit.

01:05:20.252 --> 01:05:21.437
Where did they go?

01:05:23.868 --> 01:05:25.277
You smell piss?

01:05:25.404 --> 01:05:27.067
Yeah.

01:05:27.197 --> 01:05:31.804
We're gonna stay quiet
until it's time to get loud.

01:05:32.444 --> 01:05:33.724
Okay, okay. Yeah.

01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:39.291
Get on the ground!

01:05:40.348 --> 01:05:41.724
Time to get loud?

01:05:44.924 --> 01:05:47.484
It's you who needs to get
down on the ground, pal.

01:05:48.188 --> 01:05:49.341
Or what?

01:05:53.213 --> 01:05:55.548
Or get wasted by an Expendable.

01:05:56.796 --> 01:05:59.100
Don't tell me.
You're happy to see me.

01:05:59.229 --> 01:06:02.300
Technically, you're not an
Expendable anymore, Christmas.

01:06:02.428 --> 01:06:03.837
Especially you.

01:06:03.965 --> 01:06:05.981
Such a pleasure.
Likewise.

01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:07.581
Great timing.
Easy Day.

01:06:07.709 --> 01:06:09.084
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

01:06:11.517 --> 01:06:12.540
Is that my Traumahawk?

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:14.141
Yeah.
How do you like it?

01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:16.125
Growing on me.
What took you so long?

01:06:16.253 --> 01:06:18.684
Did you think
that I was gonna believe

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:20.957
you were actually
just gifting me your knife?

01:06:21.084 --> 01:06:23.069
You gifted her your knife?

01:06:23.197 --> 01:06:24.701
And they say romance is dead.

01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:27.677
He put a tracker in it.
It was all part of the plan.

01:06:27.804 --> 01:06:30.236
Sorry.

01:06:31.068 --> 01:06:32.700
I feel a little used.

01:06:39.357 --> 01:06:40.957
Okay, let's go.

01:06:41.085 --> 01:06:43.069
Hey, Gunner, watch our six.

01:06:43.548 --> 01:06:44.668
I like your hair.

01:06:44.797 --> 01:06:46.364
- Who's your new friend?
- Decha.

01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:49.149
Old friend of Barney's. Kicks
ass with the best of them.

01:06:49.275 --> 01:06:51.164
Any friend of Barney's
is all right by me.

01:06:51.291 --> 01:06:54.140
Rahmat took Marsh.
Huh. I'm devastated.

01:06:54.268 --> 01:06:58.589
First things first. Toll Road,
I need you to take a look at something.

01:07:00.764 --> 01:07:02.908
It's a big fucking bomb.

01:07:03.037 --> 01:07:05.085
With the detonators
that we didn't get.

01:07:05.691 --> 01:07:07.005
We're fucked.

01:07:07.133 --> 01:07:08.508
Can you elaborate?

01:07:08.636 --> 01:07:10.460
This thing's wired
to go in 27 minutes.

01:07:10.588 --> 01:07:12.733
It's tamperproof.
Got mercury switches.

01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:16.093
The only way we're shutting this bad boy
down is to find the remote kill switch.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.276
That's the last line of defense.

01:07:17.405 --> 01:07:18.973
Now, it's short range,

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.501
so whoever has that on their
person is on this fucking boat.

01:07:21.629 --> 01:07:22.875
- Rahmat.
- Rahmat.

01:07:23.868 --> 01:07:24.924
Who's Rahmat?

01:07:25.053 --> 01:07:26.557
Guy who killed Barney.

01:07:26.684 --> 01:07:29.021
We probably
just entered Russian waters.

01:07:29.149 --> 01:07:31.293
Dressing this ship to look like
a US aircraft carrier

01:07:31.421 --> 01:07:33.949
with a primed nuke about to
blow off the coast of Russia.

01:07:34.077 --> 01:07:35.708
It's going
to start World War III.

01:07:36.508 --> 01:07:38.235
Clock is ticking.
Let's lock and load.

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:40.348
New location, deckside.

01:07:40.477 --> 01:07:42.845
It's all about
this kill switch now.

01:07:42.973 --> 01:07:45.245
Switch off Rahmat permanently.

01:07:45.373 --> 01:07:48.221
Well, can you make us
something loud and messy?

01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:50.397
Does the pope shit in the woods?

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:52.380
No, the pope don't shit
in the woods.

01:07:52.509 --> 01:07:55.069
Or next to a bear. Why
you gotta say shit like that?

01:09:40.508 --> 01:09:41.597
Fuck it!

01:09:49.565 --> 01:09:50.845
You're welcome.
Huh.

01:09:53.692 --> 01:09:54.845
Don't mention it.

01:10:04.637 --> 01:10:05.629
Good to be back.

01:10:09.693 --> 01:10:10.844
I got you.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.053
Thanks.

01:10:31.869 --> 01:10:33.085
Hey, <i>puta.</i>

01:10:49.372 --> 01:10:50.557
I got him.

01:11:07.357 --> 01:11:08.509
Toll Road!

01:11:08.637 --> 01:11:11.452
Easy! Man down! Man down!

01:11:16.925 --> 01:11:18.461
Can you kiss that
and make it better?

01:11:18.589 --> 01:11:21.245
Maybe later.
I'm a little busy right now.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.037
I got him.

01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:31.260
Hey!

01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:06.461
<i>Ready for prisoner exchange.</i>

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:08.317
<i>Three minutes
until we touch down.</i>

01:12:08.445 --> 01:12:10.077
Standing by for the exchange.

01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:11.997
<i>Proceed as planned.</i>

01:12:32.956 --> 01:12:34.493
How you doing, Rahmat?

01:12:35.677 --> 01:12:38.557
I see you like to play with knives.
Well, I ain't playing no more.

01:12:38.685 --> 01:12:41.629
You're gonna give me the kill switch,
and we're gonna end all this.

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.581
Come and get it, hero.

01:13:52.765 --> 01:13:54.973
Is that the biggest one
you've got?

01:14:21.245 --> 01:14:22.238
Nah.

01:14:22.877 --> 01:14:24.190
That's the biggest one I got.

01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:31.996
Lee, you good?

01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:33.308
Yeah.

01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:40.061
Where's the kill switch?

01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:43.516
You fucking idiot.
I don't have the kill switch.

01:14:44.637 --> 01:14:46.206
My boss has it.

01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:50.236
Ocelot.

01:15:07.229 --> 01:15:08.669
Phen Lyong Bai is here.

01:15:08.797 --> 01:15:11.485
He's our witness
that can identify Ocelot.

01:15:20.221 --> 01:15:21.726
- Hello, Bai.
- Oh, my God, no.

01:15:21.854 --> 01:15:23.389
No!
Bye-bye, Bai.

01:15:31.133 --> 01:15:32.350
Marsh is Ocelot.

01:15:32.476 --> 01:15:33.981
He's had the kill switch
this whole..

01:15:36.285 --> 01:15:38.365
That's for Barney.

01:15:45.981 --> 01:15:47.484
How long until detonation?

01:15:48.061 --> 01:15:48.989
Twelve minutes.

01:15:49.117 --> 01:15:50.749
All right, we got 12 minutes

01:15:50.877 --> 01:15:52.893
before this ship blows up
like a Roman candl..

01:16:03.134 --> 01:16:06.109
Hey, Marsh. I guess you
won't be needing that anymore.

01:16:06.237 --> 01:16:07.965
All right, Christmas!

01:16:08.092 --> 01:16:09.821
You're like genital warts!

01:16:09.949 --> 01:16:13.725
Always showing up where you're
not wanted and refusing to go away!

01:16:13.852 --> 01:16:15.997
You got something I need, Marsh.

01:16:16.893 --> 01:16:18.398
I'm coming down to get it.

01:16:18.525 --> 01:16:21.725
I guess you figured out
that this device right here

01:16:21.853 --> 01:16:24.061
is the only thing
preventing World War III,

01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:27.292
a conflict that,
while devastating for many,

01:16:27.934 --> 01:16:28.926
it'll be insanely,

01:16:29.054 --> 01:16:30.269
insanely,

01:16:30.397 --> 01:16:32.830
insanely profitable
for somebody.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:35.005
And that somebody
is gonna be me.

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:38.397
And the Expendables
will take all the blame!

01:16:38.526 --> 01:16:40.318
So, enjoy the show!

01:16:43.581 --> 01:16:45.150
Kill them all!

01:16:45.278 --> 01:16:46.396
Take cover!

01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:50.397
Everybody get down!

01:16:53.918 --> 01:16:56.221
We need to get clear of this
boat or we're all gonna get fried!

01:16:56.348 --> 01:16:58.429
Jumping overboard is seeming
like a decent plan right now.

01:16:58.558 --> 01:17:01.949
We'll never make it out of the blast
zone. We'll never make it in time.

01:17:05.278 --> 01:17:08.158
Hey, man,
you're not going down on my watch.

01:17:09.565 --> 01:17:11.677
We gotta move.
He's bleeding out.

01:17:12.509 --> 01:17:13.725
I got an idea.

01:17:13.853 --> 01:17:16.861
We can take my boat.
It's being towed.

01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:18.237
That's a great idea.

01:17:18.365 --> 01:17:19.710
Next time,
let's start with that!

01:17:19.838 --> 01:17:21.373
Yeah!

01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:22.909
Gunner, give us cover fire.
We're on the way out.

01:17:23.037 --> 01:17:25.148
Copy that. Cover
fire.

01:17:30.205 --> 01:17:33.118
Meet at the stern.
Repeat, meet at the stern.

01:17:38.941 --> 01:17:41.309
We gotta move!

01:17:42.974 --> 01:17:45.052
I saw them go
to the other side.

01:18:01.150 --> 01:18:03.934
There's no one on the bridge.
Start searching the ship.

01:18:13.917 --> 01:18:15.421
Toll Road, you're next.

01:18:25.086 --> 01:18:26.749
Galan, you're up.

01:18:43.102 --> 01:18:44.094
What?

01:18:46.974 --> 01:18:47.965
Never mind.

01:18:48.509 --> 01:18:50.685
Let's go.

01:19:07.965 --> 01:19:08.957
Mission first!

01:19:15.196 --> 01:19:17.212
I gotta turn this ship around.

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:23.165
Make my sacrifice count!

01:19:25.053 --> 01:19:27.068
It's his decision to make.

01:19:32.861 --> 01:19:36.477
Decha, we need to move or
Toll Road's not gonna make it.

01:19:47.197 --> 01:19:49.342
Check in block-D
then go around.

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.934
Get the rest of
the inflatable boats up here.

01:21:32.062 --> 01:21:33.886
Sir,
we're headed back out to sea.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:36.445
Move it,
move it, move it, people!

01:21:41.694 --> 01:21:43.357
Genital fucking warts.

01:21:43.486 --> 01:21:44.574
Take him out!

01:21:45.277 --> 01:21:47.390
Get that RIB inflated!

01:21:50.077 --> 01:21:51.294
We need to get the ship
back on course.

01:21:51.421 --> 01:21:53.054
Get up to the bridge
and fix this.

01:21:53.182 --> 01:21:54.142
But, Sir...

01:21:55.038 --> 01:21:56.125
But, Sir, what?

01:21:56.254 --> 01:21:57.918
The nuke is gonna blow.
We can't go up..

01:22:01.276 --> 01:22:03.229
How do you feel
about a promotion?

01:22:03.966 --> 01:22:05.277
All to the bridge!

01:22:05.405 --> 01:22:08.670
Take him down!
All to the bridge! Go, go!

01:23:06.046 --> 01:23:08.829
Looks like I'll be
seeing you soon, Barney.

01:23:32.476 --> 01:23:33.661
Christmas!

01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:43.741
Right here, Marsh.

01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:47.229
Ho ho ho! I see you
called in the cavalry!

01:23:47.901 --> 01:23:49.630
Well, you can't get rid of me.

01:23:50.238 --> 01:23:51.869
Well, the fun's in trying.

01:23:51.998 --> 01:23:54.270
Why don't you come down
face-to-face?

01:23:54.398 --> 01:23:56.158
Man-to-man.

01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:58.461
Huh.

01:23:58.589 --> 01:24:00.126
Old school.

01:24:00.254 --> 01:24:01.533
Don't mind if I do.

01:24:02.301 --> 01:24:03.678
Can't wait.

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:06.141
Don't you fucking move!
I'll be right down.

01:24:07.965 --> 01:24:12.318
Barney tried to expose me 25 years ago,
and he failed.

01:24:12.445 --> 01:24:15.294
But you, you're a good soldier.

01:24:15.902 --> 01:24:17.278
You're a very good soldier.

01:24:17.406 --> 01:24:20.414
But this, I mean,
this is above and beyond.

01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:23.070
This..
This is next level.

01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:26.558
Barney would be proud of you.

01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:29.854
Well, you can tell him yourself.

01:24:30.494 --> 01:24:32.092
Because you're
about to join him.

01:24:32.222 --> 01:24:34.334
So very nice.

01:24:34.462 --> 01:24:36.286
Look what Santa brought me.

01:24:47.934 --> 01:24:49.276
The fuck?

01:24:49.405 --> 01:24:50.462
Barney?

01:24:50.589 --> 01:24:53.054
Hey, I had him
with the classics!

01:24:53.181 --> 01:24:55.614
You almost fucking killed me!

01:24:55.741 --> 01:24:57.246
You're welcome.

01:25:00.445 --> 01:25:01.438
Come on!

01:25:02.942 --> 01:25:04.285
The fuck is happening?

01:25:04.414 --> 01:25:05.596
Hold on!

01:25:10.878 --> 01:25:12.830
Where are the nukes?
In the stern.

01:25:14.878 --> 01:25:16.990
Hey, you were dead!

01:25:17.116 --> 01:25:19.389
- The hell's going on?
- I'm a little busy.

01:25:47.581 --> 01:25:49.022
So what's the story?

01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:51.006
Twenty-five years ago,
we were doing a covert op,

01:25:51.134 --> 01:25:52.893
and eight of my team
got wiped out.

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:56.286
I had to fake my own death
to open up a classified file,

01:25:56.414 --> 01:26:00.094
driving Marsh out of hiding
so I could prove he's Ocelot.

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.790
Why'd you keep it from us?

01:26:01.918 --> 01:26:03.742
If I didn't take that job,
they'd all be alive.

01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:06.173
So, it was personal.

01:26:06.846 --> 01:26:08.701
You understand.

01:26:40.062 --> 01:26:41.054
Whew.

01:26:41.662 --> 01:26:43.165
I need a drink.

01:26:43.869 --> 01:26:44.862
Me too.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.902
- You're buying.
- I'm broke.

01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.686
You were funnier when you were dead.

01:26:52.861 --> 01:26:55.133
Great spending time
with you again.

01:26:55.262 --> 01:26:57.022
But you could use a shower.

01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:12.734
Toll Road,
you owe me 20 bucks.

01:27:12.862 --> 01:27:14.078
Guess you won't
be needing glasses.

01:27:14.205 --> 01:27:15.422
Not bad.

01:27:15.549 --> 01:27:16.606
Hey.

01:27:16.734 --> 01:27:21.086
Salute to my friends
who never quit.

01:27:21.213 --> 01:27:22.525
Cheers to you all.

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:23.485
<i>Salud.</i>
Salute.

01:27:23.614 --> 01:27:25.438
To you guys.

01:27:25.566 --> 01:27:27.773
What about that
corny quote on the ship, Christmas?

01:27:27.902 --> 01:27:31.838
- You don't need to repeat that, Toll Road.
- "Make my sacrifice count!"

01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:33.437
Yeah, fuck you.

01:27:33.566 --> 01:27:35.166
Stop giving him
such a hard time.

01:27:35.294 --> 01:27:36.894
I think it's sweet.

01:27:37.021 --> 01:27:38.750
Aw.
That's sweet.

01:27:38.878 --> 01:27:41.758
They're all just jealous because
you're the most handsome one.

01:27:41.886 --> 01:27:42.846
I know.

01:27:42.974 --> 01:27:44.478
Ain't love beautiful?

01:27:44.605 --> 01:27:46.621
Hey, Toll Road.

01:27:47.614 --> 01:27:48.797
Really?

01:27:49.566 --> 01:27:50.750
Ah.

01:27:50.878 --> 01:27:52.830
Barney Ross,
back from the dead.

01:27:52.958 --> 01:27:56.733
Only you could walk away from a blazing
inferno with not a scratch on you.

01:27:56.862 --> 01:27:59.709
You are like a mythical bird
raising up from the ashes.

01:27:59.838 --> 01:28:01.629
I don't know how you
do it. Just a moment.

01:28:01.758 --> 01:28:03.549
I am relaxed. I'm trying
to talk to my hero over here.

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.342
Would you give me some space
please, Easy Day?

01:28:05.469 --> 01:28:08.126
Hey, lame brain,
you got a minute?

01:28:08.253 --> 01:28:09.917
Of course.
A minor question.

01:28:10.046 --> 01:28:11.229
Step right in.

01:28:11.358 --> 01:28:13.438
- There it is. Piece of junk.
- Ah.

01:28:13.566 --> 01:28:14.494
I missed this.

01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:16.254
Thanks, my friend.
Yeah.

01:28:17.182 --> 01:28:19.806
I need to know.
Who the corpse is?

01:28:19.934 --> 01:28:21.085
Exactly.

01:28:21.214 --> 01:28:23.998
You ever wonder what
happened to Jumbo Shrimp?

01:28:27.838 --> 01:28:31.102
