WEBVTT

00:47.132 --> 00:49.802
<i>We are the shadows</i>

00:50.510 --> 00:53.050
<i>and the smoke, we rise.</i>

00:56.391 --> 01:01.481
<i>We are the ghosts that hide...</i>

01:04.107 --> 01:05.527
<i>...in the night.</i>

03:41.055 --> 03:42.765
Don't shoot me.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.611
Who is that?

03:51.983 --> 03:54.743
There's your money. Release the hostages.

03:54.944 --> 03:55.954
How much in there?

03:56.029 --> 03:59.779
- Three.
- You're too late. We want $5 million.

04:01.743 --> 04:03.243
Fuck, it's humid!

04:07.457 --> 04:08.457
Last chance!

04:09.250 --> 04:10.250
Take it or leave it.

04:10.627 --> 04:11.627
All at ease!

04:13.296 --> 04:14.416
Take a seat, Gunner.

04:15.131 --> 04:16.881
Hey, you're all cannon and no balls!

04:17.133 --> 04:19.343
We want the money now!

04:20.887 --> 04:22.137
- Warning shot.
- No!

04:26.309 --> 04:27.309
A little low

04:34.192 --> 04:35.232
Lights out!

05:05.515 --> 05:08.095
I'll kill him! I swear I'll kill him!

05:08.518 --> 05:11.188
If I were you,
I'd take this opportunity to leave.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.478
What's your call? You stayin'?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.570
Yeah, we tried.

05:18.653 --> 05:20.953
I'll kill them all! I don't care.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.870
There's more fools in this world
than people. So back off, cuz.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.278
You back off!

05:26.035 --> 05:29.615
You know, you're gonna be dead anyway.
So I'm gonna shut up.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.958
Last chance. Let the hostages go

05:34.460 --> 05:35.550
or you're out of there.

05:35.628 --> 05:37.838
Bring the money here to me.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.716
I need the money myself.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.092
I'll take the four on the left.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.179
Oh, here we go.

05:44.262 --> 05:46.472
Why don't you take the two on the right
and leave the rest alone?

05:46.556 --> 05:47.716
I'll kill them all!

05:47.849 --> 05:50.389
You should take the two on the right.
You're not that fast any more.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.352
The only thing faster is lightning.

05:53.479 --> 05:55.569
"Light!" Get original!

05:57.400 --> 05:59.860
Bullets go faster than blades.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.611
We'll see.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.530
Bring the money here! Now!

06:04.991 --> 06:06.411
You want the money?

06:08.578 --> 06:09.618
Go get it.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.582
Kill them!

06:17.628 --> 06:19.958
- I call that a tie.
- Come on, keep dreaming.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.799
A little compassion, folks.

06:22.008 --> 06:23.508
You know, I don't think
you hit one of them.

06:24.010 --> 06:25.340
I don't see any knives, actually.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.096
Three million doesn't buy much nowadays.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.682
How are you guys doing?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.861
- What the hell is he doing?
- Hanging a pirate.

06:36.189 --> 06:37.519
Don't be ridiculous.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.279
Gunner! What are you doing?

06:41.778 --> 06:43.278
Hanging a pirate!

06:43.946 --> 06:46.736
- That is seriously demented.
- This is no good.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.449
Not that you'd feel it,
but put one in Speed Racer's shoulder.

06:49.619 --> 06:51.449
- You're on your own.
- Appreciate it.

06:51.621 --> 06:53.121
It's good to have friends.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.957
- Gunner.
- Yeah?

06:55.041 --> 06:57.291
This isn't how we work. Let him go.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.553
Why? He'd do it to us.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.054
You know what you're doing
is a little crazy, right?

07:02.131 --> 07:03.131
That's his problem.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.302
It's your problem, too. It's a little sick.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.597
Hey, don't touch my money.

07:11.349 --> 07:13.019
Gunner, last chance.

07:13.101 --> 07:15.021
Let him go or we're letting you go.

07:15.228 --> 07:17.558
It's good to hang pirates.
Old Viking custom.

07:17.897 --> 07:19.857
It isn't an old Viking custom at all.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.674
We don't kill like that.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.747
Yeah? Not polite enough?

07:44.006 --> 07:46.126
- Let him go, Gunner.
- How are you doing, Barney?

07:46.217 --> 07:47.427
Pretty good.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.600
My partner here kicked me
with steel-tipped boots.

07:49.679 --> 07:51.509
- Can you believe that?
- You deserved it.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.136
I think I'll need stitches.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.274
Maybe.

07:54.684 --> 07:56.814
- I hate stitches.
- Everyone does.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.145
Let him go, Gunner.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.360
Let him go?

08:01.482 --> 08:02.532
Let him go.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.549
- Think he's cool?
- Go.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.232
Gunner, you cool?

08:42.523 --> 08:43.523
Yeah.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.579
No, keep it.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.710
You appreciate a good blade.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.755
Coming!

13:21.218 --> 13:22.298
Who is it?

13:22.386 --> 13:25.966
Someday you'll find a man
who'll be happy just to watch you sleep.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.194
- Hi. I didn't know you were back.
- Hey, babe.

13:34.482 --> 13:36.282
Yeah, I just arrived.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.530
- Hey.
- You look great.

13:39.487 --> 13:41.277
I wish you would have called.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.413
I've never been a good caller.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.286
I haven't heard from you in over a month.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.788
Really? Time flies, huh?

13:49.246 --> 13:51.036
Won't happen again! Sorry.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.790
But I do have a surprise.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.877
Rose-flavored. Your favorite.

13:58.380 --> 14:02.220
And I did have something else for you.

14:04.386 --> 14:08.716
It's something I picked up from Burma.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.386
It's a ruby.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.734
It's a good color,
but it's hard to see in this light.

14:15.856 --> 14:20.436
This kind of looked a little shinier
when I bought it in the shop, you know?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.406
Lace, everything all right?

14:27.076 --> 14:28.866
- Yeah.
- Who is he?

14:30.913 --> 14:31.963
He's a friend.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.332
Kind of late. You got a name?

14:37.586 --> 14:39.586
Friend. She just told you.

14:42.258 --> 14:43.378
Lee, come on.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.887
Don't leave like this. Lee, I'm sorry.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.885
I thought things were good between us.

14:47.972 --> 14:51.272
I felt like you never cared about getting
in my life or letting me into yours.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.980
- Stop.
- Yeah, sure I did.

14:54.645 --> 14:58.765
No. Not the way two people who are
serious about each other do.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.527
I have known you for over a year and a half,

15:01.610 --> 15:03.650
and I don't even know
what you do for a living.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.372
What's it matter?
When I'm here, I'm with you. That matters.

15:06.448 --> 15:10.238
That matters, but when you're here,
you're not really here.

15:10.995 --> 15:13.705
Okay? You don't talk to me.
You don't open up to me.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.329
I have no idea what you're feeling.

15:15.416 --> 15:19.036
You bring me presents.
They're beautiful presents but I want you!

15:19.420 --> 15:21.340
You're a good man. I love you, but...

15:21.422 --> 15:23.972
- Lace!
- I hate his voice.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.511
- Did you say something?
- Don't let him come down here.

15:26.594 --> 15:27.644
Did you say something?

15:27.845 --> 15:30.845
- Do not let...
- Paul, just give me a second, okay?

15:38.022 --> 15:41.362
Lee, I'm sorry.

15:42.443 --> 15:44.193
Please tell me you understand
what I'm saying.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.158
- You have to understand.
- I understand.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.204
- You take care.
- Take care.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.248
He's no good, Lace.

16:35.746 --> 16:37.206
Hey, brother, don't you ever sleep?

16:39.792 --> 16:42.382
This is my friend...

16:43.504 --> 16:44.554
What's your name again, baby?

16:44.755 --> 16:46.045
- Cheyenne.
- Cheyenne.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.221
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Cherokee, Pawnee.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.218
You want a drink?

16:50.761 --> 16:51.761
I'm good.

16:53.222 --> 16:54.852
Why don't you run upstairs

16:54.932 --> 16:59.232
and get me one of them
super-duper six-olive martinis, baby?

16:59.311 --> 17:00.981
- Anything for you, baby.
- You got it.

17:03.107 --> 17:05.397
- Got a crush on me.
- Like the last 50.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.107
Hey, brother, who's counting?

17:07.194 --> 17:09.824
- Damn, you look good.
- Look at you.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.865
You look like a goddamn
cold piece of steel, brother.

17:11.949 --> 17:16.249
Yeah, well.
Okay, my friend, let's finish this bird up.

17:16.745 --> 17:20.365
Well, let's do it, bro. It's taken you
a couple of years to do a couple of letters.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.924
We had to get rid of Gunner.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.683
Well, he went Crankenstein on your ass.
You got to cut him loose.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.052
You wanna fill in?

17:31.760 --> 17:32.850
Let me tell you something.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.808
Remember where we was last time?

17:34.930 --> 17:36.720
Where were we?
We were ass-deep in that mud and blood.

17:36.807 --> 17:40.137
- Nigeria.
- Yeah, your hand was all shot to shit.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.314
You were bleeding all over the place,
and I was bleeding,

17:43.397 --> 17:45.897
and you know what I did?
I promised myself,

17:46.942 --> 17:50.362
I don't wanna die all alone,
full of holes in the mud and blood.

17:51.989 --> 17:54.449
I'm gonna die with something that counts.
I'm gonna die with a woman.

17:54.616 --> 17:57.866
I wanna die with someone
who cares about me, you know.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.960
I don't wanna die for a woman.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.120
I wanna die laying next to a woman.
That's what I want.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.133
- It's Christmastime.
- Yeah, I can smell him from here.

18:13.594 --> 18:15.604
Mr. Christmas. How you doing, brother?

18:17.431 --> 18:18.931
I'm good, Tool.

18:19.725 --> 18:20.725
How's the missus?

18:22.227 --> 18:23.517
Yeah, all good.

18:24.438 --> 18:25.438
Oh, good.

18:26.774 --> 18:28.784
So, take a look. What do you think?

18:31.987 --> 18:33.817
It still looks like a black chicken.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.329
Black chicken?

18:38.327 --> 18:42.537
Man. It's good to see you, brother. Miss you.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.330
You're looking very beige tonight.
What's up?

18:45.667 --> 18:46.747
The usual.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.795
- All good?
- Yeah.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.416
I got a great idea.

18:50.506 --> 18:53.086
Why don't you let me doodle, like, a...

18:53.467 --> 18:55.797
Charlotte's web on your head?
On the top of your head.

18:55.886 --> 18:57.506
You know, something different,
something exciting.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.466
'Cause you got one of them
perfectly-shaped domed, muscular heads.

19:00.641 --> 19:04.561
I could put a web on the top of the head.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.895
Maybe a pregnant Charlotte
coming out of your ear,

19:07.981 --> 19:11.321
peeking around,
making sure them bugs don't come inside.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.858
Her long leg dangling down your neck.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.696
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- Very sexy.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.075
He looks thrilled.

19:19.326 --> 19:23.116
Well. Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'm feeling a little lucky tonight.

19:23.539 --> 19:25.959
I'm feeling very accurate.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.881
- Another time. Come on.
- Come on, take him on.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.876
Come on, Christmas. Bring it, baby.

19:30.963 --> 19:32.343
Don't encourage him, please.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.512
He never beat you in your life.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.880
Come on, Christmas, no disgrace in losing.

19:50.732 --> 19:51.942
Yes?

19:56.029 --> 19:57.109
Yeah.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.236
Okay.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.245
Well, I got three pieces of work.

20:06.081 --> 20:09.881
Two a walk in the park,
and one to hell and back.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.745
- I need some time alone.
- Hey, cheer up. Make the meeting.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.690
Now we can see inside of him.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.688
And I see lies.

21:58.026 --> 22:01.696
He wasn't stealing from you.
He was stealing from us both.

22:03.156 --> 22:06.326
You want your apes' respect?
Snuff those two.

22:19.923 --> 22:21.433
Let's just keep it simple.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.678
If the money's right,
we don't care where the job is.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.760
- Got it?
- Let's quit jerking off

22:25.887 --> 22:27.717
get down to business, see who's hungry.

22:27.848 --> 22:30.228
I know your real name's
probably not Barney Ross.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.689
You don't need to know my name.

22:32.769 --> 22:36.229
The only thing you need to know is
the job's real and the money's real.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.726
But since we're in this nice place,

22:39.901 --> 22:42.151
you might as well just call me Mr. Church.

22:43.155 --> 22:45.065
Okay, Church. What can I do for you?

22:45.699 --> 22:48.579
In a minute.
I'm still waiting for one more guy.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.752
Who?

23:01.715 --> 23:02.715
You know him?

23:02.799 --> 23:04.759
Yeah, we used to be
on the same team together.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.796
What's my oldest, worst friend doing here?

23:07.095 --> 23:09.425
Both of your names came
to the top of the list.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.770
- Is that a problem?
- Yeah.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.773
Should've shot him when I had the chance.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.225
Big Barney Ross.

23:15.687 --> 23:17.307
Bigger Trench mouse.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.779
- What are you doing? Praying for work?
- Could be.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.151
Have you been sick?

23:22.402 --> 23:24.532
- You've lost weight.
- Really?

23:24.780 --> 23:27.200
Whatever weight I lost, you found, pal.

23:28.909 --> 23:31.239
You guys aren't gonna start sucking
each 0ther's dicks, are you?

23:36.666 --> 23:39.336
Let's get down to business,
see who wants the work.

23:39.795 --> 23:41.375
You ever hear of an island called Vilena?

23:41.463 --> 23:43.013
- No.
- Yeah.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.378
It's a little island in the Gulf.

23:46.635 --> 23:47.635
That's right.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.349
- You should read more.
- Thanks.

23:52.265 --> 23:55.265
There are resources on that island
that my people are very interested in.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.897
But a general by the name of Garza
has overthrown the half-ass government.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.774
That's right.

24:01.775 --> 24:04.025
My people are having a problem
with this fanatic Garza.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.321
- So you want Garza gone?
- I want him dead.

24:06.822 --> 24:08.412
All it takes is a little army.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.870
Only an idiot would do this job.

24:10.325 --> 24:12.445
- How much?
- Oh, like I said.

24:15.831 --> 24:18.541
I'm busy anyway,
so give this job to my friend here.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.167
He loves playing in the jungle.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.673
- Right?
- Right.

24:21.753 --> 24:24.303
Hey, why don't we have dinner?

24:24.422 --> 24:25.512
Sure. When?

24:25.841 --> 24:27.841
- In a thousand years.
- Too soon.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.682
- What's his fucking problem?
- He wants to be president.

24:37.435 --> 24:38.935
I got to recon this island first.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.024
I'll have a contact for you on the island.

24:43.567 --> 24:44.567
Good riddance.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.493
I got a feeling everyone else
has passed on this job,

24:47.571 --> 24:49.701
so our fee is $5 mil.

24:49.990 --> 24:52.700
-$5 mil?
- And I want half upfront,

24:52.784 --> 24:54.294
and the other half in an offshore account.

24:54.369 --> 24:57.539
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

24:58.665 --> 25:02.495
What I have a problem with
is people who try to fuck me over.

25:04.921 --> 25:08.341
So if you take this money
and you don't deliver,

25:09.968 --> 25:12.388
me and my people

25:12.470 --> 25:15.600
are gonna come get you and your people

25:15.682 --> 25:20.232
and chop you up
into little fucking dog treats.

25:21.688 --> 25:22.808
You got a problem with that?

25:29.279 --> 25:30.199
Let's talk.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.764
Whoever stood you up sounds bad.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.218
Yeah, but it will pay good.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.681
Yeah, well, money aside.
What happened to your code?

25:51.760 --> 25:52.760
What code's that?

25:53.094 --> 25:54.974
"The target has to deserve it."

25:56.014 --> 25:57.934
That was canceled due to lack of interest.

25:59.684 --> 26:03.524
- You're dark. Dark and cold.
- You noticed.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.272
- And I ain't buying into that, by the way.
- You will.

26:09.861 --> 26:12.241
Stick around, young man, you will.

26:17.452 --> 26:18.662
Vilena.

26:25.961 --> 26:26.961
Next job?

26:29.214 --> 26:30.344
They got work there?

26:34.552 --> 26:35.802
Come on.

26:36.304 --> 26:37.854
You know you shouldn't be here, Gunner.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.853
Don't replace me.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.308
I'm good.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.435
I'm still good.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.444
You're still using.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.145
I can't trust you any more, man.

26:51.152 --> 26:53.492
- You can't trust me?
- Hmm.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.793
You can't trust me?

26:59.327 --> 27:00.327
I can't.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.209
You can't trust me?

27:14.592 --> 27:15.892
Be careful.

27:15.969 --> 27:17.429
You threatening me, Gunner?

27:19.180 --> 27:22.060
Nah, I'm a nice guy.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.649
So, going over the info
this guy Church gave me,

27:33.737 --> 27:36.607
there's probably about
6,000 people on the island.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.203
How many soldiers?

27:38.533 --> 27:39.663
Maybe a couple of hundred.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.828
It wouldn't take much more than that
to control a space that small.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.080
You do know that.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.830
Great, they've got a small army.

27:48.126 --> 27:49.166
What do we got?

27:49.419 --> 27:50.499
Four and a half men.

27:51.463 --> 27:53.303
That smells disgusting.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.800
Disgusting? Chicken gumbo is bad,

27:57.218 --> 28:00.678
but eating on rats and gorilla nipples,
that's delicious?

28:01.431 --> 28:02.521
Not so funny.

28:03.558 --> 28:05.098
- I need a raise.
- Why?

28:05.185 --> 28:06.765
I need more money for my son.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.555
I want to send him to a better school.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.067
- Did Yin Yang get a family?
- I have no idea.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.029
You don't ask, I don't tell.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.243
Anyway, the pay share stays the same.

28:17.197 --> 28:18.447
That's the way it's gonna be.

28:18.615 --> 28:21.025
Now the target on this island
is a guy named General Garza.

28:21.242 --> 28:24.082
- What's the problem?
- Who gives a shit what the problem is?

28:24.746 --> 28:26.826
We got enough problems
right here of our own.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.958
We don't get rid of those first,
they're gonna get rid of us.

28:30.377 --> 28:33.087
Toll Road, when was
the last time you saw your analyst?

28:35.340 --> 28:37.260
- This morning.
- Yeah? What'd you talk about?

28:40.261 --> 28:42.431
Avoidant personality disorder.

28:42.597 --> 28:43.637
You think too much.

28:43.765 --> 28:47.515
You know, Toll Road, you're a great guy,
a little fucked up, no doubt about it,

28:47.602 --> 28:49.402
and you're always gonna have
unusual problems, right?

28:49.479 --> 28:51.649
- Yeah.
- You're talking about my ear.

28:52.399 --> 28:53.939
Come on. Don't start with the ear again.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.235
- Not the ear story.
- The ear story, not again.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.360
- We all know the ear story.
- We don't want to hear the ear story.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.855
- We all know I wrestled in college.
- Right.

28:59.948 --> 29:04.448
A common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear, a clot.

29:05.036 --> 29:08.156
Which, if left unattended,
causes a contraction in the cartilage

29:08.373 --> 29:10.423
and forms cauliflower ears.

29:10.667 --> 29:14.127
My college roommate used to bring up
my ear configuration all the time.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.131
Parties, social events, you name it.

29:17.465 --> 29:19.925
That didn't really bother me all that much
because he's usually bragging about

29:20.009 --> 29:22.759
how my ears are a badge of courage.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.973
- Made me a little less self-conscious.
- Of course it would.

29:26.641 --> 29:27.731
But that was short-lived.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.770
One morning, during spring break,
I hear him on the phone, bagging on me,

29:31.896 --> 29:34.016
talking about my "queer ear."

29:36.401 --> 29:37.651
You see something funny?

29:37.735 --> 29:39.025
Sorry, go ahead.

29:39.654 --> 29:43.624
So I realize I'd become the brunt of a joke
simply because I look a little bit different.

29:44.242 --> 29:46.492
So I decided to educate my roommate

29:46.578 --> 29:50.038
on the common decency that should be
afforded people who look a little different.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.333
I smashed him upside his goddamn head!

29:53.835 --> 29:55.165
Several times.

29:56.212 --> 29:59.012
Until he had a little cluster
of cauliflower all his own.

29:59.674 --> 30:02.724
- And your point is?
- It ain't easy being green.

30:04.679 --> 30:06.679
The fuck you think I'm talking about?

30:10.018 --> 30:13.058
Anyway, me and Christmas
are gonna head down to Vilena

30:13.146 --> 30:15.226
and scout the island
to see if we should take the job.

30:15.315 --> 30:18.025
How much we get paid?
I need more money for my family.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.574
What fucking family are you talking about?

30:22.864 --> 30:24.034
My family.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.366
You know, don't ask.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.047
Listen, that girl wasn't your type.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.604
Her loss, right?

30:45.845 --> 30:47.755
I should have broke that bastard's jaw.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.557
Maybe you were lucky.
He could have broke yours.

30:49.807 --> 30:53.477
- Impossible.
- You know, Christmas, I understand,

30:53.561 --> 30:56.561
but let's just say you were with her
for a couple of hours,

30:56.648 --> 30:58.478
and it's nice, and it's hot and heavy,

30:58.566 --> 31:00.356
but after that, think about it.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.323
What do you do for the rest of the day?

31:02.904 --> 31:04.534
She probably did you a favor.

31:04.614 --> 31:07.244
Now you have more time
to feel sorry for yourself.

31:08.451 --> 31:09.791
You're a bleak bastard.

32:14.267 --> 32:16.847
Morning. Morning.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.901
Morning! Speak English?

32:24.235 --> 32:25.315
Big plane, huh?

32:26.404 --> 32:29.244
Yeah, we use it to transport
injured animals.

32:29.324 --> 32:31.834
- Why are you here?
- Ornithologists.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.453
We're photographing exotic birds.

32:46.799 --> 32:47.879
You're nervous?

32:47.967 --> 32:49.217
Nervous?

32:50.678 --> 32:52.758
No. Why?

32:52.847 --> 32:54.557
You just look nervous.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.978
I'm not nervous. Do I look nervous?

32:58.770 --> 33:00.520
Your skin looks a little dry.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.148
That's because of the altitude.

33:02.231 --> 33:05.741
Well, it's not the altitude.
You fly with the window open all the time.

33:05.818 --> 33:08.028
- Dehydration.
- Yeah, it is dehydration.

33:08.112 --> 33:11.872
But there's ways to get around that.
There's new skin, it's like stem cell research.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.196
You are looking handsome.
Don't worry about it.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.075
- You're jealous?
- I'm a little jealous. Yeah.

33:16.204 --> 33:18.004
You're younger.
You have youth on your side.

33:18.539 --> 33:22.289
Overall, I'm happy to be myself. Are you?

33:22.835 --> 33:24.375
- So you're done.
- Done.

33:25.171 --> 33:26.961
- Good to know you.
- Good to know you.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.378
Yeah, we do this all the time.

33:28.966 --> 33:31.046
We kid ourselves.
That's how we stay awake on the plane.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.852
I'm the only one who stays awake
on the plane.

33:32.929 --> 33:35.179
- He's always sleeping.
- Yeah, you're right.

34:15.138 --> 34:17.768
- What's the address?
- Yeah, it's in my head.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.887
Do you wanna share it?

34:20.518 --> 34:22.438
It's the Gloria Cantina.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.440
So actually, Cantina Gloria in Spanish.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.983
Spanish. Who are you, Zorro?

34:29.694 --> 34:31.114
Army.

34:31.195 --> 34:32.485
- Shit.
- Come on.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.822
In there.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.470
- You rolling?
- No, I'm on holiday.

34:57.722 --> 34:59.772
You, you, move the truck!

35:04.437 --> 35:05.937
Get the suit. Tighten up on the suit.

35:06.022 --> 35:07.272
Got him.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.905
Look at these clowns,
hand-picked monkeys.

35:27.335 --> 35:28.495
What's wrong with this picture?

35:31.214 --> 35:32.474
Everything.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.510
Let's get out of here.

35:36.010 --> 35:37.350
No, that's the point, you know.

35:37.470 --> 35:39.890
You think you know someone,
and you truly do not.

35:39.972 --> 35:42.982
Aren't you the guy who said,
"The man who best gets along with women

35:43.059 --> 35:45.019
"is the man who can
get along without them"?

35:45.102 --> 35:46.942
No, no. You're so not listening.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.818
I'm talking about when you give all
the control to the woman.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.740
- You relinquish the power.
- Right.

35:52.819 --> 35:54.739
- You give it all to the girl.
- Right.

35:54.862 --> 35:58.622
Right at that very moment is the time
that she will tear out your heart.

35:58.699 --> 36:01.829
She'll screw the milkman,
she'll get pregnant with a stranger.

36:01.911 --> 36:04.211
I'm telling you,
it's exactly what's happening

36:04.288 --> 36:07.828
and it's repeating itself
every relationship I have.

36:07.917 --> 36:08.917
It's the same.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.131
Truthfully, she wasn't your type.

36:10.211 --> 36:12.591
- Well, I wasn't finished.
- Look, enjoy your freedom.

36:12.755 --> 36:15.005
- Yeah, you wait till it happens to you.
- It has.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.223
Contact's late.

36:23.766 --> 36:25.346
All right, let's go.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.188
Chill.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.571
One of the nuts has legs.

36:32.066 --> 36:33.936
I hate this outfit. I hate this hat.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.026
Take it off.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.630
Have you ever been rejected?

36:54.380 --> 36:55.630
Would you be sad if I was dead?

37:00.595 --> 37:03.715
You're really pushing the boundaries
of our relationship, you know that?

37:18.362 --> 37:20.622
- Is that the contact?
- Could be.

37:23.618 --> 37:24.908
Too bad she's so homely.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.294
Stay focused.

37:29.624 --> 37:30.714
Are you the contact?

37:30.917 --> 37:32.457
I'm Sandra.

37:32.710 --> 37:33.790
What are your names?

37:34.045 --> 37:35.795
Buda, Pest.

37:40.051 --> 37:41.431
Follow me, please.

37:46.223 --> 37:48.313
Buda and Pest? Nice.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.820
Did you do all these?

38:03.324 --> 38:05.664
Yes. Take one.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.240
A gift.

38:07.370 --> 38:08.750
I don't take free gifts.

38:10.831 --> 38:12.541
- How much you want for it?
- Nothing.

38:12.625 --> 38:14.585
Taking money for something is not a gift.

38:15.169 --> 38:17.459
Taking nothing for something is.

38:18.047 --> 38:19.507
Is it like this all the time?

38:19.924 --> 38:22.184
This place was a beautiful place.

38:22.677 --> 38:27.007
Then one day, they came with money,
and General Garza sold his soul.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.809
And people who fight back are killed.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.391
You said "they" came with money.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.436
Who's "they"?

38:31.519 --> 38:33.349
Some Americans. That's all I know.

38:33.938 --> 38:36.228
But someday all of this will change back.

38:37.817 --> 38:38.937
You really believe that?

38:39.026 --> 38:40.106
Yes.

38:43.531 --> 38:44.781
You have a family, Sandra?

38:45.616 --> 38:47.946
My mother, when I was little, she died.

38:48.035 --> 38:50.955
And my father, he's gone, too.

38:51.872 --> 38:52.872
Do you?

38:52.999 --> 38:53.999
- Me?
- Yes.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.673
He has a truck and a seaplane.

38:59.839 --> 39:01.719
Sandra, how close
can you get to the palace?

39:01.799 --> 39:03.549
The palace? Why?

39:03.968 --> 39:06.218
We just wanna check out the view.

39:06.721 --> 39:07.851
There is no view.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.560
Why don't we just go there anyway, okay?

39:24.030 --> 39:25.320
Where is my grove?

39:26.741 --> 39:28.701
Where is your manpower?

39:33.497 --> 39:36.667
Do you know how long it takes
for a coca field to produce?

39:36.959 --> 39:38.379
Of course you don't. Let me tell you.

39:38.711 --> 39:40.671
We are eight weeks behind schedule.

39:40.963 --> 39:44.183
Kick your peasants' asses.
Get me my product.

39:44.425 --> 39:48.505
When you talk like this to me
in front of my men, it's no good.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.601
I am your lifeline.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.188
I am the one who coordinates
all this confusion.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.564
I am making you rich.

39:57.772 --> 39:59.822
And being wealthy is very good.

39:59.899 --> 40:03.939
It allows people to be the real asswipes
nature intended them to be.

40:08.574 --> 40:13.294
Sometimes things
are just not worth the money.

40:13.746 --> 40:14.746
Sure they are.

40:26.342 --> 40:28.682
Sandra, I was wondering about something
you were saying.

40:29.428 --> 40:30.968
- From a female point of view...
- What are you doing?

40:31.138 --> 40:34.348
Conversing. Look it up.
Out of curiosity,

40:34.475 --> 40:37.975
you ever have a person you liked
disrespect you in a bad way?

40:38.646 --> 40:39.856
Dis...

40:39.939 --> 40:42.069
I'm not sure what the Spanish is
for "disrespect."

40:42.316 --> 40:45.356
Come on. Why don't you man up? Jesus!

40:45.528 --> 40:46.528
She wasn't your type.

40:46.654 --> 40:49.074
Why don't you just keep saying,
"She wasn't my type?"

40:49.323 --> 40:51.493
So I could put a bullet in your bleak brain!

40:52.034 --> 40:54.584
Look who I'm talking to.
Dracula's life coach.

40:54.745 --> 40:56.115
No wonder you're alone.

40:56.747 --> 40:57.957
Sandra, are we close?

40:58.082 --> 40:59.252
It's just over there.

40:59.667 --> 41:01.037
- Pull over, please.
- Yeah, really.

41:08.092 --> 41:10.892
- Where is he going?
- I'm glad you asked.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.012
Well, I suppose you could say

41:13.180 --> 41:16.810
we like to look at the world
from different views.

41:20.187 --> 41:23.397
You... You got a black heart.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.530
She wasn't your type.

41:35.619 --> 41:36.789
We should get going.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.038
He's very emotional.

42:19.663 --> 42:21.673
What are you looking for?

42:25.085 --> 42:28.665
Sandra, how do I know
you're not setting us up?

42:29.340 --> 42:31.300
What does "setting us up" mean?

42:31.467 --> 42:33.757
You don't look like the kind of person
that we deal with all the time.

42:33.844 --> 42:35.934
How did you get involved in this?

42:36.222 --> 42:38.022
An American came here.

42:38.098 --> 42:42.138
He asked my friend to show you around.
He was afraid, so he asked me to.

42:42.269 --> 42:43.269
And you're not afraid?

42:43.437 --> 42:44.937
I'm afraid.

42:45.147 --> 42:47.397
But he said maybe you can help Vilena.

42:48.275 --> 42:49.855
I don't think so.

42:49.944 --> 42:50.954
Why not?

42:52.238 --> 42:53.408
To get this place going again,

42:53.489 --> 42:55.619
you have to rip the guts out of it
and start from the ground up

42:55.699 --> 42:58.289
and even I don't think
that's worth the money,

42:59.453 --> 43:02.373
so if I were you, I'd leave. Just leave.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.626
You should leave.

43:20.599 --> 43:22.349
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

43:56.093 --> 43:57.183
Run!

44:22.536 --> 44:23.786
- Get her.
- Got it.

44:37.885 --> 44:39.135
Are you crazy?

44:39.511 --> 44:41.561
- You could have killed me!
- You're welcome.

44:46.769 --> 44:47.769
What?

44:49.813 --> 44:52.573
All right, speed it up. We're on the way.

44:57.488 --> 44:58.988
If we get out of here, it's a miracle.

45:00.741 --> 45:02.581
- She's coming with us, right?
- She'd better.

45:05.412 --> 45:06.912
- How can we leave?
- We got a plane.

45:07.081 --> 45:09.581
- No, I can't leave.
- Yeah, well, you don't have a choice.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.626
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah? They'll find you in an hour.

45:11.794 --> 45:14.424
- Maybe, but I'm staying.
- Staying for what? There's nothing here.

45:14.630 --> 45:15.920
Not to you.

45:18.801 --> 45:20.931
Look, if you stay, then you're dead.
She's leaving with us.

46:08.976 --> 46:11.346
- I got the guys inside.
- Give me a 60-second lead.

46:11.437 --> 46:13.057
- You got it. Go, go, go!
- Come on.

46:29.705 --> 46:30.705
Get in.

46:31.999 --> 46:33.039
- Get in.
- No.

46:33.125 --> 46:34.665
- Get in.
- No, no, I can't.

46:34.751 --> 46:36.551
- Let's go.
- I can't. I belong here.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.708
- There's no time.
- Go, you go.

46:38.839 --> 46:40.009
Please, go.

46:40.674 --> 46:41.724
Shit.

46:59.359 --> 47:00.359
Hey!

47:02.362 --> 47:03.362
You look nervous.

47:26.720 --> 47:27.800
Come on!

47:43.570 --> 47:44.570
Come on!

47:50.369 --> 47:51.579
Run, you bastard!

48:28.657 --> 48:30.737
- Where's the girl?
- Gone. She wouldn't leave.

48:30.951 --> 48:32.491
Wouldn't leave?

48:32.578 --> 48:34.448
Why the hell would anybody wanna stay?

48:44.631 --> 48:45.971
The hell...

48:48.552 --> 48:49.972
The hell With it.

48:50.053 --> 48:52.643
- Climb, baby, climb.
- Come on, baby.

49:04.526 --> 49:05.526
God damn it.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.374
- Going back?
- Yeah.

49:15.537 --> 49:17.617
- Fry and die.
- Fry and die. Let's do it.

50:29.903 --> 50:31.363
What are they doing?

50:51.007 --> 50:52.087
Yes!

51:03.770 --> 51:04.940
Great job.

51:05.939 --> 51:07.109
That was a statement!

51:25.625 --> 51:29.245
How did two obvious professionals
pass right through security personnel,

51:29.337 --> 51:31.757
kill 41 soldiers and get away?

51:32.883 --> 51:34.553
With help, that's how.

51:35.218 --> 51:37.798
Everything's under control,
except one detail,

51:38.472 --> 51:42.022
a daughter who wants her father
and company dead and gone.

51:42.142 --> 51:43.772
Bad Shakespeare.

51:44.269 --> 51:47.019
Somehow the company parasites got to her.

51:47.147 --> 51:48.817
Look, she's your daughter, and that's tragic.

51:50.692 --> 51:52.822
But blood or not, she goes.

51:53.653 --> 51:55.413
Call it the price of doing business.

51:56.198 --> 51:57.988
<i>You don't kill your familia.</i>

51:58.575 --> 52:01.365
Come around my house
during the holidays, pal.

52:21.348 --> 52:22.678
Nice bird.

52:23.683 --> 52:25.483
First of all, I don't feel comfortable

52:25.560 --> 52:28.150
talking business with a giant
carrying a shotgun.

52:28.271 --> 52:29.611
Pretty boy wouldn't give it up.

52:30.065 --> 52:31.225
Not if you wanna know where they are.

52:31.691 --> 52:32.691
What do you know?

52:33.068 --> 52:34.068
I used to be one of them.

52:38.824 --> 52:39.834
Why are you turning on them?

52:40.033 --> 52:41.373
Lovers' quarrel.

52:42.619 --> 52:43.619
We settle on 50.

52:43.703 --> 52:45.213
No, math whiz.

52:45.539 --> 52:48.289
We settle on 100 grand,
upfront, in my pocket.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.585
The guy thinks he's a real badass.

52:50.877 --> 52:52.497
Actually, I'm a horror show.

52:55.632 --> 52:57.302
This geezer's a bloody joke

52:57.425 --> 52:58.675
Life's a joke, gum-chew.

53:00.554 --> 53:03.724
I've been standing in a space
about the size of your mouth for six hours.

53:04.057 --> 53:06.387
If you don't want that Fu Manchu
knocked back into the '60s,

53:06.476 --> 53:09.806
you'd better keep your gum-chewing trap
shut and show some respect!

53:10.397 --> 53:11.517
Hey.

53:12.399 --> 53:14.279
Need a facelift, pretty boy?

53:14.901 --> 53:16.151
Bring it.

53:17.195 --> 53:18.235
Back off, Paine.

53:18.321 --> 53:19.321
I'm gonna kill him.

53:19.406 --> 53:20.616
We need him.

53:22.367 --> 53:23.617
Back off!

53:28.748 --> 53:30.458
Here's what I think is happening.

53:30.542 --> 53:33.922
This guy who calls himself Church
is really a front for the CIA.

53:34.087 --> 53:36.047
So we're working for the agency?

53:36.256 --> 53:38.546
Yeah.
Church hired us to take out the General,

53:38.633 --> 53:41.603
but the real target's this guy,
James Munroe.

53:43.597 --> 53:45.927
He used to be with the agency,
but got greedy,

53:46.016 --> 53:47.596
went rogue and teamed up with the General

53:47.684 --> 53:50.024
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves.

53:50.103 --> 53:52.113
And that's a big cash loss.

53:52.188 --> 53:55.148
But Church and the agency
can't afford to send in the Navy SEALs

53:55.233 --> 53:57.943
or the Special Forces
to take out one of their own.

53:58.194 --> 54:01.204
That'd be a bad headline,
so they hire us to kill him.

54:02.365 --> 54:03.775
And they're back in business.

54:03.992 --> 54:06.122
- And we're taken out.
- Nobody's gonna miss us.

54:07.495 --> 54:09.615
- Is it still $5 million?
- You'd never live to spend it.

54:09.956 --> 54:11.116
I'm telling Church the deal's off.

54:12.876 --> 54:14.416
Sound about right?

54:14.502 --> 54:15.632
That's about right.

54:15.712 --> 54:16.712
I agree.

54:42.822 --> 54:44.072
You still got the helmet?

54:46.952 --> 54:48.162
Where is he?

55:01.925 --> 55:04.215
- Who the hell is that?
- Some punk.

55:04.803 --> 55:06.853
- Don't worry about it.
- We got your back.

55:07.347 --> 55:10.177
If he comes over here, we'll bust his ass.

55:16.731 --> 55:17.861
What do you want?

55:19.192 --> 55:20.442
Your life.

55:21.444 --> 55:22.574
I was thinking about taking it.

55:22.654 --> 55:23.664
Is that right?

55:23.780 --> 55:27.870
But I don't do so well in tight spaces,
so going to prison worries me.

55:29.077 --> 55:30.287
You shouldn't have bruised her face.

55:30.537 --> 55:31.537
Really?

55:31.621 --> 55:33.421
I would have liked to have kept it
the way it was.

55:33.873 --> 55:35.293
Keep the bitch, 'cause I'm done with it.

56:07.282 --> 56:08.372
Lee.

56:13.913 --> 56:17.633
Next time, I'll deflate all your balls, friend.

56:27.427 --> 56:29.887
Now you know what I do for a living.

56:30.638 --> 56:32.348
I'm not perfect, but you should have waited.

56:34.100 --> 56:35.810
I was worth it.

57:44.337 --> 57:45.837
Where is she?

58:01.187 --> 58:02.857
So your daughter paints, too?

58:03.857 --> 58:05.527
This is how it starts!

58:05.859 --> 58:07.319
There's nothing here. Let's go.

58:07.402 --> 58:08.952
Or how it ends!

58:45.064 --> 58:48.154
What's the matter, Barney?
Don't you ever sleep?

58:48.234 --> 58:50.154
No. What happened to your girlfriend?

58:50.737 --> 58:53.357
Another one bites the dust, brother.

58:54.240 --> 58:58.660
I was gonna paint this for her,
and you know what? I'm gonna finish it.

58:58.870 --> 59:01.080
Then I'm just gonna smash the shit
out of it.

59:01.372 --> 59:02.462
You wanna be alone?

59:04.417 --> 59:06.537
Not really. So, what's up?

59:06.920 --> 59:08.590
On this island, there was this girl.

59:08.922 --> 59:11.092
There usually are.

59:11.257 --> 59:16.007
You know, she showed us around.
She was the target's daughter.

59:17.805 --> 59:21.635
And when she had a chance to leave,
she didn't do it.

59:23.019 --> 59:24.939
She had some guts.

59:26.397 --> 59:28.857
Why can't I get that out of my mind?

59:30.443 --> 59:32.323
You know, she stands for something.

59:32.779 --> 59:34.409
You know, man, we don't stand for shit.

59:34.489 --> 59:39.699
We used to, but that dried all up,
like this is gonna dry all up.

59:39.869 --> 59:42.119
This here paint is gonna dry.

59:43.122 --> 59:44.462
What dried up?

59:46.960 --> 59:49.420
Just belief, man. Just the belief in the soul,

59:49.504 --> 59:52.594
just, I don't know,
the human parts, brother.

59:54.133 --> 59:56.303
You remember that time
we was up in Bosnia?

59:57.220 --> 1:00:00.560
We took down them Serb bad boys.

1:00:02.934 --> 1:00:06.194
All our guys were getting chopped up
all around us,

1:00:07.146 --> 1:00:08.976
and there was blood everywhere.

1:00:09.065 --> 1:00:10.815
I never thought I was gonna make it
out of there,

1:00:10.900 --> 1:00:13.490
-and I know you didn't, either.
- Yeah.

1:00:13.569 --> 1:00:17.119
Kind of feeling like dead, too, you know?

1:00:17.198 --> 1:00:19.948
My head's all a very black place.

1:00:20.034 --> 1:00:22.004
I don't believe in shit.

1:00:22.870 --> 1:00:25.710
Just goddamn Dracula black.

1:00:26.916 --> 1:00:31.586
I remember I got this bottle of the local shit
they have over there, that Slivovitz.

1:00:31.671 --> 1:00:34.841
I don't know,
I think that's what it was called.

1:00:35.675 --> 1:00:37.755
And I ain't feeling no pain now.

1:00:39.387 --> 1:00:40.847
And I'd come up on this...

1:00:42.557 --> 1:00:45.437
I'd come up on this old wooden bridge,
and I see this...

1:00:46.769 --> 1:00:48.269
I see this...

1:00:51.399 --> 1:00:54.899
I see this woman standing there, you know?
And she's...

1:00:56.446 --> 1:00:57.986
I stepped out, and she saw me,

1:00:58.072 --> 1:01:02.742
and she's just looking right in my eyes,
and I was looking right in her eyes.

1:01:04.454 --> 1:01:06.414
I knew what she was gonna do.

1:01:06.497 --> 1:01:09.957
She looked at me,
and I knew she was gonna jump.

1:01:11.210 --> 1:01:12.250
You know what I did, man?

1:01:12.337 --> 1:01:17.547
I just turned around and I kept walking,
until I heard that splash.

1:01:21.346 --> 1:01:23.006
Then she was gone.

1:01:24.849 --> 1:01:27.229
And after taking all them lives,

1:01:27.393 --> 1:01:32.943
here was one that I could have saved,
but I didn't.

1:01:35.526 --> 1:01:37.896
And what I realized later on was,

1:01:40.239 --> 1:01:43.529
if I had saved that woman, I might have,

1:01:45.995 --> 1:01:48.705
I don't know,
saved what was left of my soul, you know?

1:02:23.408 --> 1:02:24.618
Sandra,

1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:28.750
short for Alexsandra,
which is Latin for "Defender of mankind,"

1:02:28.830 --> 1:02:30.000
and, bingo, here you are.

1:02:30.081 --> 1:02:31.371
Now that's synergy.

1:02:33.668 --> 1:02:35.248
You're not following that.

1:02:35.670 --> 1:02:40.170
And I know you're probably not,
illiteracy being 98% in your country.

1:02:40.258 --> 1:02:41.628
Try following this.

1:02:42.301 --> 1:02:48.561
A very wise dead man once told me
that a real man never strikes a woman.

1:02:49.976 --> 1:02:54.306
You push some if you have to,
but you never strike them.

1:02:55.982 --> 1:02:59.072
This man, however,
does not share that moral dilemma.

1:02:59.986 --> 1:03:04.986
So the question, Sandra,
why were the Americans here?

1:03:52.872 --> 1:03:54.712
Don't fight back.

1:03:56.334 --> 1:03:57.844
Just relax.

1:04:29.033 --> 1:04:31.913
Again, what did the Americans tell you?

1:04:32.495 --> 1:04:34.075
Who were they after?

1:04:36.874 --> 1:04:38.294
Continue.

1:05:05.319 --> 1:05:06.649
You wanted answers.

1:05:06.779 --> 1:05:07.909
Not like that!

1:05:08.406 --> 1:05:09.776
Whatever you say.

1:05:22.420 --> 1:05:25.300
- I'm going back to Vilena.
- Yeah? Something change?

1:05:25.464 --> 1:05:27.174
- What's the plan?
- There is no plan.

1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:30.680
- Wait, wait, wait. We need a strategy.
- I'm going. You're not.

1:05:30.761 --> 1:05:33.431
- What?
- I said I'm going. You guys aren't.

1:05:33.639 --> 1:05:36.389
- What are you, out of your mind?
- It's personal business.

1:05:36.475 --> 1:05:39.055
- You don't owe that woman nothing.
- I didn't say I did.

1:05:39.145 --> 1:05:41.185
You want to kill yourself? Go ahead, fine.
Your call.

1:05:41.272 --> 1:05:44.282
Listen, I don't want to kill myself.
You guys, take care. I got to do this.

1:05:44.358 --> 1:05:46.278
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:48.110
Don't lay this guilt crap on us.
We don't deserve it.

1:05:48.195 --> 1:05:52.735
This is my choice. There's no guilt.
There's no guilt. Take care.

1:05:58.414 --> 1:06:01.254
Yeah, fuck it. His choice. Yeah.

1:06:10.343 --> 1:06:11.473
I said I'm going alone.

1:06:11.552 --> 1:06:12.552
I'm going, too.

1:06:12.762 --> 1:06:14.562
Come on, Yang, get the hell out.

1:06:14.722 --> 1:06:16.182
Just drive.

1:06:25.775 --> 1:06:28.025
Don't lose your nerve.

1:06:29.654 --> 1:06:31.864
Don't talk to me, cockroach.

1:06:43.459 --> 1:06:45.499
So, why are you doing this?

1:06:45.586 --> 1:06:47.296
Friends die together.

1:06:49.048 --> 1:06:51.338
Hey. Give me the good luck ring. Come on.

1:06:52.593 --> 1:06:54.263
Don't make me hurt you, Yang. Come on.

1:06:54.637 --> 1:06:57.427
- Speed better than luck.
- Whatever.

1:06:59.225 --> 1:07:00.265
It's difficult.

1:07:00.726 --> 1:07:01.726
What is?

1:07:02.019 --> 1:07:04.019
My life is difficult. I need more money.

1:07:04.188 --> 1:07:05.148
Why is that?

1:07:05.231 --> 1:07:07.271
- I work harder than the rest.
- No, you don't.

1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:12.030
Yes, I do. Because they're taller,
everything is harder for me.

1:07:12.113 --> 1:07:16.413
When I get hurt, the wound is bigger
because I'm smaller.

1:07:17.243 --> 1:07:19.083
When I travel, I need to go farther.

1:07:19.161 --> 1:07:20.581
I know, 'cause you're smaller, right?

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:22.160
Yes.

1:07:24.083 --> 1:07:25.383
My life is harder than you think.

1:07:27.586 --> 1:07:30.836
- I need more money.
- I know. You told me.

1:07:30.923 --> 1:07:32.303
For your family, right?

1:07:32.508 --> 1:07:33.758
I don't have family.

1:07:33.926 --> 1:07:35.426
I know.

1:07:36.512 --> 1:07:37.812
Maybe one day I will.

1:07:38.889 --> 1:07:40.139
Down!

1:08:06.542 --> 1:08:08.042
- Get out there!
- Why me?

1:08:08.252 --> 1:08:09.382
Because you're smaller.

1:08:27.313 --> 1:08:28.443
Do that again, I'll kill you!

1:09:04.850 --> 1:09:06.060
Gunner!

1:09:11.649 --> 1:09:12.649
Come on, Gunner.

1:09:14.193 --> 1:09:15.193
Man's good.

1:09:48.727 --> 1:09:51.807
What are you doing? You're dead, junkie!

1:09:58.028 --> 1:09:59.238
Insect

1:10:13.002 --> 1:10:14.092
Bail!

1:10:22.928 --> 1:10:24.178
Shit!

1:10:53.042 --> 1:10:54.132
Yang!

1:10:54.877 --> 1:10:56.667
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1:10:58.130 --> 1:10:59.510
It's over!

1:10:59.715 --> 1:11:01.295
Let's talk about this.
I forgive you, Yang!

1:11:06.347 --> 1:11:07.467
That almost hurt.

1:11:07.932 --> 1:11:08.932
Back off!

1:11:16.106 --> 1:11:18.816
What do you wear, size three?
Bring it, happy feet.

1:11:49.598 --> 1:11:50.638
Come on, bring it!

1:12:29.096 --> 1:12:30.136
Size matters.

1:12:39.732 --> 1:12:40.732
Gunner!

1:12:40.816 --> 1:12:41.976
Hello, karma!

1:12:47.865 --> 1:12:48.945
Shit!

1:13:17.644 --> 1:13:19.104
You shot me.

1:13:20.064 --> 1:13:22.574
Hey, don't say that.
You were gonna kill him.

1:13:22.900 --> 1:13:24.490
No, I was just gonna scare him.

1:13:24.777 --> 1:13:27.487
Don't say that. You never liked him.
You were gonna kill him.

1:13:28.113 --> 1:13:29.573
That's true.

1:13:35.245 --> 1:13:36.535
Am I dying?

1:13:37.122 --> 1:13:39.002
The shot's a couple of inches
above your heart.

1:13:42.211 --> 1:13:45.511
Gunner, who sent you? Who hired you?

1:13:46.924 --> 1:13:48.304
Who cares?

1:13:48.383 --> 1:13:49.893
Who cares? I care.

1:13:50.469 --> 1:13:55.139
Don't go out a total asshole.
For once, cooperate.

1:13:55.641 --> 1:13:59.311
Who sent you? Who hired you?
Tell me. Let me make it right.

1:14:00.187 --> 1:14:01.607
Bury me right.

1:14:02.856 --> 1:14:04.606
And I want a Viking funeral.

1:14:06.985 --> 1:14:09.485
You mean where they put you in a boat
and set you on fire, Viking?

1:14:09.571 --> 1:14:11.491
- That's right!
- You're not a Viking.

1:14:12.074 --> 1:14:13.834
So what? Who cares?

1:14:14.159 --> 1:14:17.079
If that's what you want, you got it.

1:14:17.496 --> 1:14:20.116
Who sent you? ls the girl still alive?

1:14:20.290 --> 1:14:21.330
Come closer.

1:14:40.644 --> 1:14:42.354
You know, it's not easy being your friend.

1:14:43.063 --> 1:14:44.273
That's true.

1:14:44.356 --> 1:14:46.856
Man, we'll die with you.
Just don't ask us to do it twice.

1:14:47.359 --> 1:14:49.859
I know the layout.
I'll tell you about it on the way.

1:14:51.029 --> 1:14:52.659
What the hell happened to you?

1:14:52.739 --> 1:14:54.199
It's too sad to talk about it.

1:14:57.953 --> 1:14:59.293
Let's fly.

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:19.770
You know, the enemy's
always been terrified of noise,

1:15:20.100 --> 1:15:21.890
especially shotguns.

1:15:23.312 --> 1:15:25.902
With this big boy spitting out
250 rounds a minute,

1:15:25.981 --> 1:15:27.691
you tell me who's tolerating that.

1:15:29.985 --> 1:15:32.775
You know what? I trust you.

1:15:33.530 --> 1:15:35.070
I want you to meet my girlfriend.

1:15:35.365 --> 1:15:38.195
Omya Kaboom.

1:15:38.410 --> 1:15:40.700
When Omya's prime is struck,

1:15:41.371 --> 1:15:44.711
she gets off a miniature warhead
that arms itself.

1:15:44.917 --> 1:15:47.877
And when that happens,
anything that gets in my lady's way

1:15:47.961 --> 1:15:50.671
becomes instant red sauce and Jell-O.

1:15:50.756 --> 1:15:52.006
And if that doesn't work

1:15:56.261 --> 1:15:58.011
her sister will.

1:16:00.098 --> 1:16:03.598
So let me get this right.
Gunner tries to kill you, you shoot him

1:16:03.936 --> 1:16:05.766
and, at death's door,
he gives you the whole layout?

1:16:05.938 --> 1:16:07.018
Something like that.

1:16:07.105 --> 1:16:09.185
But I had to promise him this Viking funeral.

1:16:09.274 --> 1:16:11.284
You know, where you have to
spread the ashes over the ocean.

1:16:12.110 --> 1:16:14.030
What a way to poison
about a thousand whales.

1:16:14.112 --> 1:16:15.362
At least.

1:16:17.407 --> 1:16:19.487
Listen, we owe the big bastard a send-off.

1:16:19.952 --> 1:16:22.002
- I would have win.
- I know you would have win.

1:16:22.079 --> 1:16:24.539
<i>Mumbo jumbo, hoodoo lady, hoodoo</i>

1:16:24.790 --> 1:16:30.250
<i>Mumbo jumbo, hoodoo lady, hoodoo</i>

1:16:30.420 --> 1:16:33.380
<i>Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom-lay, boom!</i>

1:16:38.470 --> 1:16:39.470
More like a million whales.

1:18:02.512 --> 1:18:04.892
It's 3:36. We have 20 minutes
to take this place down.

1:18:04.973 --> 1:18:06.813
I'll take the cellar.

1:18:06.892 --> 1:18:08.192
We've got company.

1:18:09.394 --> 1:18:10.694
I got him. You guys take off.

1:18:39.174 --> 1:18:41.894
Is there a reason you've taken
the soldiers this man has trained

1:18:41.968 --> 1:18:44.388
and made them look like fools?

1:18:45.263 --> 1:18:47.523
They look like warriors.

1:18:51.770 --> 1:18:53.940
Warriors loyal to me.

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:59.400
I thought the people of Vilena
hired these mercenaries to kill me.

1:19:00.779 --> 1:19:05.279
But then I think maybe this is your plan,
because you cannot control me.

1:19:05.742 --> 1:19:08.832
And torturing Sandra works for you.

1:19:09.788 --> 1:19:12.498
You want to kill her to make me suffer.

1:19:14.042 --> 1:19:17.302
A man can never kill a child.

1:19:18.463 --> 1:19:19.633
But you can.

1:19:20.132 --> 1:19:21.552
You're losing your mind.

1:19:22.134 --> 1:19:25.224
You do not control me!

1:19:27.639 --> 1:19:29.559
Bring Sandra here.

1:19:30.642 --> 1:19:34.482
Bring her now or I will kill you.

1:19:34.813 --> 1:19:36.023
Go get her.

1:22:35.327 --> 1:22:39.247
- No, no.
- Sandra, Sandra, it's me. Sandra.

1:22:39.873 --> 1:22:43.253
Hey, it's me, it's me. Sandra, it's me.

1:22:43.835 --> 1:22:46.665
It's me. It's me. It's okay.

1:22:47.964 --> 1:22:50.134
Nobody's gonna hurt you, all right?

1:22:50.216 --> 1:22:51.376
How are you here?

1:22:51.968 --> 1:22:53.008
I just am.

1:22:55.180 --> 1:22:57.020
- Can you move?
- Yes.

1:22:57.599 --> 1:22:58.599
Okay.

1:22:58.683 --> 1:23:00.943
Yeah, okay. All right, let's go.

1:23:15.950 --> 1:23:18.580
- Get off.
- Let's see what you got here.

1:23:19.371 --> 1:23:20.711
Nice.

1:23:21.373 --> 1:23:22.623
Goddamn.

1:23:23.041 --> 1:23:26.461
I'm having these babies, seeing as
you ain't gonna need them any more.

1:23:32.801 --> 1:23:34.591
All right, I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

1:23:36.096 --> 1:23:37.556
You're gonna give me answers.

1:23:38.848 --> 1:23:40.808
If they're not the right answers, you will die.

1:23:42.894 --> 1:23:44.104
Why are you here?

1:23:45.313 --> 1:23:46.363
Bird watching.

1:23:49.651 --> 1:23:50.901
Bird watching.

1:23:52.570 --> 1:23:54.070
Stop him!

1:23:54.406 --> 1:23:56.406
- This is not his fight. It's mine.
- Get her out of here.

1:23:57.617 --> 1:23:59.037
Seal the building.

1:24:01.371 --> 1:24:02.621
You're a real tough guy, aren't you?

1:24:02.956 --> 1:24:04.076
What?

1:24:09.254 --> 1:24:10.264
Time's up.

1:24:10.338 --> 1:24:11.668
- Where's Barney?
- What's the call?

1:24:11.923 --> 1:24:12.923
We can't find him in 10 minutes,

1:24:13.007 --> 1:24:14.007
we're going out the same way we came in.

1:24:14.092 --> 1:24:15.092
- No way.
- That's what he'd want.

1:24:15.218 --> 1:24:17.298
Ten minutes! Let's go.

1:24:21.558 --> 1:24:23.388
Hi. What's your name?

1:24:23.852 --> 1:24:25.692
- You having fun yet, mate?
- Yeah, not bad.

1:24:25.812 --> 1:24:27.272
Personally, I'm glad you came back.

1:24:27.439 --> 1:24:28.439
Yeah?

1:24:31.818 --> 1:24:32.818
Get him up.

1:24:35.947 --> 1:24:37.447
Stand him up.

1:24:41.619 --> 1:24:44.039
You know,
if you didn't have this Kevlar vest,

1:24:44.372 --> 1:24:46.542
your insides are gonna be
like fucking mush.

1:24:46.750 --> 1:24:47.920
Well, ain't that sad?

1:24:48.251 --> 1:24:49.211
You know, you're a lucky man.

1:24:49.294 --> 1:24:50.754
You're the lucky man.

1:24:50.879 --> 1:24:52.959
No, no, you're a lucky man.

1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:55.970
- He told me to keep you conscious.
- Did he?

1:24:58.178 --> 1:24:59.928
All right. All right.

1:25:03.975 --> 1:25:05.385
Now this is your last time.

1:25:05.685 --> 1:25:09.145
You give me the right answer,
and I'll cut you a break.

1:25:11.107 --> 1:25:14.067
If you give me the wrong answer,
you will die a damn slow death.

1:25:14.152 --> 1:25:15.702
Do you understand me?

1:25:15.779 --> 1:25:17.569
- Do you understand me?
- Yep.

1:25:17.655 --> 1:25:20.325
- Who sent you?
- Can't breathe.

1:25:20.784 --> 1:25:22.244
Loosen up.

1:25:22.911 --> 1:25:24.161
Who sent you?

1:25:26.664 --> 1:25:28.674
Your hairdresser.

1:26:31.229 --> 1:26:32.689
You're good.

1:27:50.808 --> 1:27:51.848
Go, we gotta go!

1:28:12.830 --> 1:28:14.580
Come on.

1:28:38.356 --> 1:28:39.516
Shit!

1:29:01.379 --> 1:29:02.669
Remember this shit at Christmas!

1:29:06.426 --> 1:29:07.426
Damn, that thing's loud.

1:29:07.510 --> 1:29:10.050
- What happened to you?
- I got my ass kicked.

1:29:14.100 --> 1:29:15.230
Damn, that stings!

1:29:15.601 --> 1:29:16.641
Suck it up!

1:29:16.728 --> 1:29:18.228
Come on. Get my rifle. Let's go.

1:29:38.332 --> 1:29:39.462
What's this?

1:29:41.794 --> 1:29:44.464
Everything bad that has happened,
you bring.

1:29:44.547 --> 1:29:46.127
Take your money!

1:29:47.258 --> 1:29:50.428
I only see death with you. Take it all and go.

1:29:50.762 --> 1:29:51.972
I'm not going anywhere.

1:29:52.055 --> 1:29:53.305
You are done here.

1:29:53.389 --> 1:29:54.679
You can't succeed without me.

1:29:54.891 --> 1:29:56.021
I am the leader.

1:29:56.184 --> 1:29:57.314
You're a puppet in a hat.

1:29:59.395 --> 1:30:00.395
No.

1:30:19.290 --> 1:30:20.540
Now!

1:30:23.586 --> 1:30:24.916
Get back.

1:30:27.965 --> 1:30:29.125
This shit's getting old.

1:30:34.305 --> 1:30:35.765
<i>Throw down your weapons.</i>

1:30:37.350 --> 1:30:38.890
<i>There's no way out.</i>

1:30:41.354 --> 1:30:43.524
- Your lucky ring stinks.
- I know.

1:30:44.023 --> 1:30:45.613
- Let's backtrack.
- The building's rigged.

1:30:45.691 --> 1:30:47.571
It's the only way out.

1:30:58.329 --> 1:30:59.459
Chopper's ready in five minutes.

1:30:59.539 --> 1:31:00.579
We're not leaving yet.

1:31:10.383 --> 1:31:13.143
- What's he saying?
- He said we're dead with an accent.

1:31:13.219 --> 1:31:14.599
We ain't dead.

1:31:14.679 --> 1:31:16.349
- Blow the building.
- Not yet.

1:31:16.514 --> 1:31:20.024
We will kill this American disease.

1:31:37.702 --> 1:31:39.042
Blow the building!

1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:40.250
She's still in there!

1:31:40.496 --> 1:31:41.996
The money!

1:31:47.336 --> 1:31:48.376
Blow it!

1:31:52.967 --> 1:31:53.967
Blow it!

1:32:00.099 --> 1:32:03.059
She's out. Blow the fucking building!

1:33:46.998 --> 1:33:48.458
I'm out!

1:34:44.555 --> 1:34:46.215
Let's go. Come on.

1:34:47.224 --> 1:34:48.604
Cut Munroe off!

1:35:48.911 --> 1:35:50.001
Come on!

1:37:05.029 --> 1:37:06.029
Hey!

1:37:06.530 --> 1:37:07.820
- Thing's too heavy.
- Give me it.

1:37:07.907 --> 1:37:10.617
- What do you want me to do?
- Throw it as hard as you can.

1:37:35.935 --> 1:37:37.685
- Blow the dump.
- Got it!

1:38:10.386 --> 1:38:11.426
Munroe!

1:38:12.930 --> 1:38:16.350
Drop the weapons,
or I'll put a bullet through her eye.

1:38:18.769 --> 1:38:19.849
Don't test me.

1:38:30.906 --> 1:38:32.236
No,no,no.

1:38:32.408 --> 1:38:34.738
Shut up or I'll kill you.

1:38:36.787 --> 1:38:39.667
The agency parasites hired you,
didn't they?

1:38:39.748 --> 1:38:43.588
I'd have paid you twice as much
to go fishing.

1:38:44.128 --> 1:38:46.628
You'd have to think
I'm pretty freaking stupid

1:38:46.714 --> 1:38:48.474
to surrender to the agency.

1:38:48.591 --> 1:38:53.351
Why would I do that? I created this.
I made it all happen.

1:38:53.721 --> 1:38:57.851
And then they wanted me out. Why?
Because I saw the big picture.

1:38:58.142 --> 1:39:01.772
Unlike people like her father, you,
the agency,

1:39:02.396 --> 1:39:04.316
you see life through a freaking keyhole

1:39:04.398 --> 1:39:06.858
because you let emotions
cloud your judgment.

1:39:07.443 --> 1:39:10.703
Emotions are the cancer of the intellect!

1:39:10.863 --> 1:39:12.033
Stop walking.

1:39:13.824 --> 1:39:17.494
And what about me and you?
We're both the same.

1:39:17.953 --> 1:39:21.543
We're both mercenaries.
We're both dead inside.

1:39:22.708 --> 1:39:24.338
So why the hell did you come after me?

1:39:24.585 --> 1:39:27.205
I didn't come after you, dipshit.
I came for her!

1:39:47.232 --> 1:39:48.942
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:39:49.735 --> 1:39:51.395
Call it a tie.

1:39:53.864 --> 1:39:55.204
Yeah, I guess so.

1:39:55.783 --> 1:39:57.873
You know, you're not as fast as you think.

1:39:58.369 --> 1:40:00.079
I'm beginning to sense that.

1:40:41.412 --> 1:40:45.082
The second account number's mine.
It'll help get things going around here.

1:40:45.416 --> 1:40:47.956
No, I can't. You've done so much.

1:40:48.043 --> 1:40:51.593
Yeah, well, so have you. A gift for a gift.
You take it.

1:40:52.423 --> 1:40:56.393
- Will you come back?
- I promise I'll always be around.

1:41:01.765 --> 1:41:02.885
Take care.

1:41:32.296 --> 1:41:33.296
What?

1:41:34.006 --> 1:41:35.006
Truthfully?

1:41:35.632 --> 1:41:36.632
Yeah?

1:41:37.259 --> 1:41:39.139
I never really thought she was your type.

1:42:04.495 --> 1:42:06.325
All right, baby. All right.

1:42:06.413 --> 1:42:07.793
Come on, let's see what you got.

1:42:10.417 --> 1:42:11.707
That's my boy!

1:42:16.048 --> 1:42:17.218
Go south!

1:42:23.138 --> 1:42:24.808
You lost! You lost!

1:42:28.602 --> 1:42:31.062
So you're back from the dead.
How you healing?

1:42:31.522 --> 1:42:34.982
Good, considering
you could have killed me.

1:42:35.484 --> 1:42:36.694
I forgive you.

1:42:37.194 --> 1:42:38.494
Okay.

1:42:39.071 --> 1:42:40.071
I would have win.

1:42:41.281 --> 1:42:42.451
Never.

1:42:45.536 --> 1:42:46.946
Hey, Gunner.

1:42:47.204 --> 1:42:50.124
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, brother. Therapy.

1:42:51.083 --> 1:42:52.883
- What's he saying?
- He said try therapy.

1:42:55.879 --> 1:42:56.959
Man's got a point.

1:43:04.263 --> 1:43:05.393
You know what?

1:43:06.348 --> 1:43:08.058
I'm gonna do you a favor, Tool.

1:43:08.892 --> 1:43:11.142
"I once knew a man called Tool..."

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:13.270
I love poetry.

1:43:13.689 --> 1:43:17.069
"To me, was the epitome of cool

1:43:18.443 --> 1:43:19.653
"He was good with a knife

1:43:22.698 --> 1:43:24.408
"Bad With a Wife..."

1:43:25.742 --> 1:43:26.742
That hurts.

1:43:26.910 --> 1:43:29.160
"But to think he could beat me

1:43:30.205 --> 1:43:33.325
"Dreaming he'd defeat me

1:43:34.835 --> 1:43:36.165
"Cool Tool

1:43:38.505 --> 1:43:39.585
"You gotta be a fool"

1:43:43.969 --> 1:43:45.259
Oh, yeah.
