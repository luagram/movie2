WEBVTT

01:01.322 --> 01:03.541
Okay. You ready?

01:16.598 --> 01:18.208
It's beautiful.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.341
- Where'd you find this?
-  It's cute, right?

01:20.515 --> 01:23.344
Aw, I love this!

01:23.518 --> 01:24.867
So cute.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.175
It's perfect!

01:34.572 --> 01:37.140
It would've been,
you know, a lot for me.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.099
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.406
It's perfect.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.234
You're perfect.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.673
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.418
Are they here already?

01:54.592 --> 01:55.985
They're like 30 minutes early.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.552
- Why are they-- What?
- Hey.

01:57.726 --> 01:58.509
It's okay.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.559
I love it.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.474
Yeah?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.215
I'll be honest.
Ally and I, you know,

02:08.389 --> 02:10.652
we weren't sure about
whether to have this party,

02:10.826 --> 02:13.176
but together there's nothing
we can't overcome.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.873
You're the strongest
woman I know.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.832
I love you more than anything.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.312
And I'm so damn excited

02:18.486 --> 02:19.878
to keep building
our lives together.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.967
- Me too. I love you.
- Love you.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.361
Aw.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.102
Why don't you ever say
anything like that about me?

02:26.276 --> 02:28.409
Thank you all for being here.
Thank you.

02:31.629 --> 02:32.543
Vitamins are on the table.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.197
Oh. Thank you, baby.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.507
- It was a nice party.
- Yeah.

02:39.681 --> 02:40.595
Think everyone had a good time.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.466
Yeah. You deserve it.

02:44.207 --> 02:47.079
You're just buttering me up
before you abandon me.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.517
I wish I could delay it again.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.083
- I know.
- I don't want to
leave you here.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.781
You just go to the judge

02:52.955 --> 02:54.652
and tell him something
wildly inappropriate

02:54.826 --> 02:56.263
and then come back to me.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.090
- I will.
- Oh, you will?

02:58.265 --> 02:59.570
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah. I got some--
- Oh, you will? Like what?

02:59.744 --> 03:01.355
- I'll say...
- What?

03:01.529 --> 03:03.183
I'll say we're having
a big old orgy tomorrow night

03:03.357 --> 03:04.314
and they're all invited.

03:04.488 --> 03:05.707
Ow!

03:05.881 --> 03:07.012
Ooh. No, no, no.
Be careful. Careful.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.710
All right.
That got me too excited.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.148
All right.

03:13.671 --> 03:14.759
Hey.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.108
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.773
<i>Just a reminder to send in
those mail-in ballots soon.</i>

03:28.947 --> 03:31.080
<i>We're only two weeks out
from election date, folks,</i>

03:31.254 --> 03:32.864
<i>and every ballot matters.</i>

03:33.038 --> 03:34.605
<i>So be sure to get yours in
before it's too late.</i>

03:39.654 --> 03:41.003
<i>Faith, come on.</i>

03:41.177 --> 03:42.700
<i>Polling has you
at a 46-point deadlock,</i>

03:42.874 --> 03:44.876
<i>with 8% of voters
still undecided.</i>

03:45.050 --> 03:46.922
<i>We need to push your plan
to reduce the crime rate</i>

03:47.096 --> 03:48.053
<i>in order to pull ahead.</i>

03:48.228 --> 03:49.707
But this case is my campaign.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.056
He's a dangerous criminal

03:51.231 --> 03:52.623
with a long history
of violence.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.495
I put James Sythe away, we win.

03:54.669 --> 03:55.931
<i>If you lose, you lose
your shot at being DA.</i>

03:56.105 --> 03:57.324
- All right. I got to go.
<i>- Faith--</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:09.814
Oh. There she is.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.731
Hey. Excuse me!

04:13.905 --> 04:15.124
You, uh...

04:15.298 --> 04:16.256
You dropped this.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.388
Oh. I did.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.911
Oh, my God. Thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.261
No worries. Have a good day.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.610
Yeah. You too.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.224
- Through that door.
-  Oh, thank you.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.488
Where do I go
for, uh, jury duty?

04:31.662 --> 04:32.620
Go down there.

04:34.970 --> 04:35.971
Thanks.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.467
All right, guys.
Eyes up.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.685
Pay attention.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.298
<i>Hello.
I'd like to welcome you</i>

04:58.472 --> 05:00.865
<i>as a juror in the Georgia
court system.</i>

05:01.039 --> 05:03.955
<i>As a juror, you protect
the right of every person</i>

05:04.129 --> 05:05.566
<i>to a trial by jury.</i>

05:05.740 --> 05:07.263
<i>The right to a trial by jury</i>

05:07.437 --> 05:09.918
<i>is a cornerstone
of our democracy.</i>

05:10.092 --> 05:11.485
<i>That right is protected</i>

05:11.659 --> 05:13.443
<i>by the United States
constitution.</i>

05:16.098 --> 05:17.099
There she is.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.666
Sugar-free vanilla with skim.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.363
Ah. You're good.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.364
- Can I get you something else?
-  Mmm-mmm.

05:21.538 --> 05:22.800
You got something for me?

05:22.974 --> 05:24.802
Okay.
Voluntary manslaughter

05:24.976 --> 05:26.500
with a recommendation
of 20 years.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.110
Fifteen to serve,
followed by five on probation.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.633
Wow. That's a hell of a deal.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.635
I will even waive
the recidivist statute

05:31.809 --> 05:33.202
if he pleads before
we strike the jury.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.812
And admit to something
he didn't do?

05:34.986 --> 05:37.641
Save it
for the jury.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.296
Better yet, why don't you
plead your guy out

05:40.470 --> 05:42.777
and say, free
for your caseload.

05:42.951 --> 05:43.908
Look...

05:45.345 --> 05:46.955
my client wants a trial.

05:47.129 --> 05:50.175
Well, then, you're wasting
my time and your client's.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.351
Last chance.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.397
After you.

06:02.187 --> 06:06.235
The case you're about to hear
is an alleged homicide.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.890
The state is charging
James Michael Sythe

06:09.064 --> 06:10.413
with malice murder

06:10.587 --> 06:13.590
for the death
of Kendall Alice Carter.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.376
Now, if any of you have
a personal relationship

06:16.550 --> 06:18.552
with the accused,
and/or the deceased

06:18.726 --> 06:20.989
that will prohibit you
from serving on this panel

06:21.163 --> 06:22.947
in an unbiased manner,

06:23.121 --> 06:24.340
please speak now.

06:32.783 --> 06:33.697
Yes.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.398
He used to ride my bus.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.183
And when was this?

06:42.619 --> 06:45.361
I don't know.
Few years ago.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.973
Okay. Then there's no reason
we can't leave it there.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.454
I think you'll make
a fine juror.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.674
Does anyone else think

06:53.848 --> 06:57.025
that they're incapable
of serving on this panel?

06:58.287 --> 06:59.375
Yes.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.726
Uh...

07:02.900 --> 07:04.336
Your Honor, my wife
is in the third trimester

07:04.511 --> 07:06.164
of a high-risk pregnancy.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.602
I'd like to be
available to her.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.299
Well, that's commendable.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.388
What hours
do you normally work?

07:13.476 --> 07:15.391
Uh, 9:00 to 6:00, typically.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.175
Then you have my word
that this court

07:17.349 --> 07:20.918
will not demand one minute more
of your time than that.

07:22.659 --> 07:23.486
Yeah.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.098
See, the fact that
you don't want to be here

07:27.272 --> 07:28.752
is exactly what makes you

07:28.926 --> 07:31.886
the perfect group
to judicate this case.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.932
You are impartial.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.109
You have no skin in the game.
Nothing to gain or lose.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.677
And that is why I believe
that this process,

07:40.851 --> 07:43.637
as flawed as it may be,

07:43.811 --> 07:46.466
is still our best chance
at finding justice.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.645
Do you work, Mrs. Aldworth?

07:51.819 --> 07:53.560
Well, I had the toughest
job there is.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.692
I raised two kids
and just sent them off
to college.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.520
- Ah. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.262
And have you ever served
on a jury before?

08:00.436 --> 08:02.699
Twice. Both were mistrials.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.745
Twice. Okay. Okay.

08:04.919 --> 08:08.662
Mr. King. Have you ever had
a physical altercation

08:08.836 --> 08:10.707
with a significant other?

08:10.881 --> 08:13.449
Are you gonna ask that question
to every guy in this courtroom?

08:15.407 --> 08:16.931
If I have to, I will. I...

08:17.105 --> 08:19.977
I know these questions
can be very personal--

08:20.151 --> 08:21.109
Nah, man.

08:21.979 --> 08:22.937
That ain't me.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.202
Thank you, sir.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.598
How long have you lived
in the area, Mr. Chicowski?

08:31.772 --> 08:33.251
About ten years.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.731
And you, uh...

08:34.905 --> 08:36.037
Oh, you run a flower shop?

08:36.211 --> 08:38.213
Yeah. With my wife.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.302
Mr. Robinson, it says here
your wife has

08:40.476 --> 08:42.652
primary custody
of your daughter.

08:42.826 --> 08:43.784
Is that correct?

08:47.091 --> 08:48.832
Yeah.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.052
Do you mind if I ask you
who ended the marriage?

08:53.010 --> 08:53.881
She did.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.014
Thank you. All you.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.799
Mr. Kemp.

09:00.452 --> 09:01.628
And you're a magazine writer?

09:01.802 --> 09:03.064
Uh, that's right.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.413
What kind of articles
do you write?

09:04.587 --> 09:06.023
Features, mostly.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.634
So you write
about a variety of topics?

09:07.808 --> 09:09.026
Yes.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.855
Ever written
about a murder trial?

09:12.029 --> 09:15.206
Uh, well, I write for
a regional lifestyle magazine

09:15.380 --> 09:17.208
so it's not exactly
<i>Vanity Fair.</i>

09:19.036 --> 09:20.560
Take that as a no.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.823
Being a writer,
I imagine you read a lot.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.955
You've read anything
about this case?

09:25.129 --> 09:27.088
No. No. Today's the first
I've heard about it.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.786
Well, then, I think you'll make

09:29.960 --> 09:32.920
a perfectly acceptable
member of this jury.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.705
All right. Does the defense
accept or challenge?

09:37.228 --> 09:40.014
We accept him, Your Honor.

09:40.188 --> 09:44.584
Good. Please enter Justin Kemp
as juror number two.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.762
-  Hey.
-  Hi!

09:48.936 --> 09:50.546
-  Hi.
-  How did it go?

09:50.720 --> 09:51.939
No.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.593
- I got picked.
- No.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.029
- Mmm.
- I'm so sorry.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.596
I know.

09:56.770 --> 09:57.858
What happened
to "wildly inappropriate"?

09:58.032 --> 09:58.859
Ah. Well,
I'm saving that for you.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.861
Oh, yeah?

10:01.035 --> 10:03.211
They said
it'll be a short trial.

10:03.385 --> 10:04.516
I feel like
they always say that,

10:04.691 --> 10:06.127
- but I hope so.
- I know.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.129
How was your day?

10:08.303 --> 10:10.522
It was okay.
I did this.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.612
Yeah? It's good progress.
Looks good.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.570
-  Thank you.
- All day?

10:14.744 --> 10:16.050
No, this did not
take me all day.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.965
- Yeah.
- I watched a documentary...

10:18.139 --> 10:21.403
- Mmm-hmm. What about?
- ...and I peed 94 times.

10:21.577 --> 10:24.014
- Ninety-four? Okay.
- And I ate some ice.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.276
- Ooh.
- Can I have some more?

10:25.450 --> 10:26.408
- You need some more? Ice?
- Yeah.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.888
Ice. Coming up. All right.

10:41.466 --> 10:44.513
The people need to know
how I'll make this city safer.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.515
And women need to know that,

10:46.689 --> 10:48.299
if they're in
an abusive relationship,

10:48.473 --> 10:49.823
their community has their back.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.086
The rest? The rest is noise.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.435
So, thank you.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.180
Thank you, guys.
Thank you for coming.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.617
Thank you. Thank you so much.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.228
Thank you. Hey!
Thank you so much.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.708
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.188
Thank you so much. Yeah.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.147
Hey. Good job.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.632
-  Hey.
- Hey.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.416
Nice speech.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.378
Thanks.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.510
"Justice is truth in action"?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.730
Mmm-hmm. Professor Nielsen.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.863
Yeah. No. Yeah, I remember.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.474
You still believe it?

11:34.432 --> 11:35.607
Of course.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.436
All right.
As long as it doesn't

11:38.610 --> 11:40.525
get in the way of a win,
though, right?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.963
Oh, my God.
If you got something to say,
Eric, just say it.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.792
Mmm. I'm saying, he...

11:45.966 --> 11:48.098
You know, he loves you.
You were his favorite student.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.232
Are you really going there?

11:51.406 --> 11:53.669
- Yeah, I'm going there.
- Oh, my God!

11:53.843 --> 11:55.323
And now you're a...

11:57.281 --> 11:58.239
What?

11:58.935 --> 12:00.328
I'm a what?

12:00.502 --> 12:01.982
A politician.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.552
Good morning.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.380
We will begin
with opening statements.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.773
Ms. Killebrew.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.431
Okay. The facts
of the case are these.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.956
One year ago, on October 25th,
the defendant, James Sythe,

12:20.130 --> 12:22.524
and his then-girlfriend,
Kendall Carter,

12:22.698 --> 12:24.134
went drinking
at Rowdy's Hideaway

12:24.308 --> 12:25.353
on Old Quarry Road.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.842
Come on. I walked all the way
up there and got it.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.713
- Take the drink.
- I'm already drunk, babe.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.862
Things got tense.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.298
They had a fight.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.473
Not fair
what you're doing.

12:58.647 --> 12:59.996
Hey, leave it alone.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.911
What the hell
is wrong with you?

13:02.085 --> 13:03.043
I've already told you.
We're not moving in together.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.522
I'm not...

13:04.696 --> 13:06.089
- What is wrong with it?
- Stop pushing me.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.351
- I told you, stop...
- I'm not pushing you.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.135
I said stop pushing!

13:13.314 --> 13:14.881
Jesus Christ.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.621
<i>She stormed
out of the bar</i>

13:16.796 --> 13:18.188
<i>and he followed her.</i>

13:20.756 --> 13:22.062
The fight escalated,

13:22.236 --> 13:24.151
and things quickly
got out of control.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.545
Hey.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.025
What the hell are you doing?

13:29.199 --> 13:30.897
- What are you doing?
- Get away from me.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.289
Don't touch me.

13:32.463 --> 13:34.117
- How dare you?
- Are you kidding me?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.909
It was par
for the course.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.780
They'd argue. They'd break up.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.390
And they'd make up the next day

13:46.564 --> 13:47.914
after they both
had calmed down.

13:48.088 --> 13:51.134
It was basically a game.

13:51.308 --> 13:54.268
Now, this couple
had a history of violent
interactions,

13:54.442 --> 13:57.358
but this time she was serious.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.968
She was done with him.

13:59.142 --> 14:02.580
So she left and headed
down the road, on foot.

14:16.116 --> 14:19.597
So this was just
another typical night of drama.

14:19.771 --> 14:23.166
So James Sythe got in his car
and he drove home.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.910
He flew into a violent rage

14:28.084 --> 14:31.087
and followed Kendall Carter
down the road...

14:32.697 --> 14:34.612
where he proceeded to kill her.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.505
He beat her viciously.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.203
He pushed her over a railing
to the creek below...

15:01.813 --> 15:03.119
and left her to die.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.603
James Sythe didn't attack her

15:52.777 --> 15:54.431
and he couldn't have pushed her

15:54.605 --> 15:56.825
because he wasn't there.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.137
James Sythe...

16:06.878 --> 16:08.010
took an innocent life.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.144
James Sythe...

16:11.318 --> 16:12.493
is an innocent man.

16:16.584 --> 16:17.759
Thank you.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.221
Damn, man.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.006
- You... You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.661
Yeah. Just those
crime scene pictures.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.012
Never had a strong stomach.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.623
Yeah.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.320
All right.
Well, you have a good night.

16:57.973 --> 16:58.974
You, too.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.685
God grant me the serenity

17:14.859 --> 17:17.427
to accept the things
that I cannot change,

17:17.601 --> 17:20.213
the courage to change
the things that I can,

17:20.387 --> 17:22.780
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.261
Great work, everybody.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.784
Keep coming back.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.830
It works if you work it.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.179
Great job, everybody.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.355
Right on, bro!

17:35.228 --> 17:36.533
Hey, Justin.

17:36.707 --> 17:37.752
Hey!

17:37.926 --> 17:39.145
You were quiet tonight.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.408
Yeah. I've got
a lot on my mind.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.062
Yeah, I can tell.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.847
You want to talk about it?

17:46.021 --> 17:49.068
Okay, look, whatever it is,
my advice is the same.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.113
You know what to do.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.941
We're only as sick
as our secrets.

17:53.942 --> 17:54.986
Yeah.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.249
Okay, I'm always here for you.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.950
Working late?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.692
Be out of your way in a minute.

18:48.866 --> 18:49.954
Nah, take as long as you want,
I'll come back.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.808
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.333
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.551
How was the meeting?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.118
It was good.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.076
I stayed after
to talk with Larry for a bit.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.036
You okay? Your heart.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.343
- Hmm?
- Are you okay?

19:31.779 --> 19:32.736
Yeah, I'm good.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.652
Everything's going to be fine.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.090
We're going
to be a family soon.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.788
Hmm.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.051
Very soon, I hope.

19:56.717 --> 19:57.631
What the...

20:11.166 --> 20:13.473
I'd seen them in there before.
A couple times.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.127
Um, it was always
the same thing.

20:16.302 --> 20:19.218
They would start off
fun and flirty, and then,

20:19.392 --> 20:21.742
after a few drinks,
things would change.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.483
Change, how?

20:23.657 --> 20:25.833
That night, she came in,

20:26.007 --> 20:29.880
trying to talk to him,
like, seriously, you know?

20:30.054 --> 20:32.883
But he wasn't having it.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.233
What's wrong with you?

20:34.407 --> 20:35.712
What, do you want me
to disagree?

20:35.886 --> 20:37.323
No. I want you to say,
"I love you, too."

20:38.237 --> 20:39.499
I basically did.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.674
I want you to say,
"I love you, too."

20:40.848 --> 20:42.110
Read between the goddamn lines,

20:42.284 --> 20:43.894
I said, "Yeah."

20:44.068 --> 20:45.461
-  What lines?
-  I'm sick of this shit.

20:45.635 --> 20:46.767
What lines
are you talking about?

20:46.941 --> 20:47.550
Hey,
get out of my face!

20:49.248 --> 20:52.642
<i>He got mad.
Like, scary.</i>

20:52.816 --> 20:54.209
<i>She leaves.</i>

20:56.472 --> 20:59.562
<i>He follows her outside.
So I started following.</i>

20:59.736 --> 21:00.694
Hey!

21:01.825 --> 21:03.174
What the hell are you doing?

21:03.349 --> 21:04.611
What are you doing?

21:04.785 --> 21:05.742
I want to go home.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.790
- I don't want
to do this anymore.
-  Do what?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.922
I'm done.
You're embarrassing!

21:12.096 --> 21:13.228
What are you talking about?

21:13.402 --> 21:14.534
Who cares
what these idiots think?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.712
What are you going to do?
Hit me?

21:18.886 --> 21:20.148
- Relax. I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.497
- It was...
- What are you going to do?

21:21.671 --> 21:23.456
- How dare you?
- Are you kidding me?

21:23.630 --> 21:24.587
Bring it on!

21:27.024 --> 21:28.809
You better get the fuck
out of here right now.

21:31.942 --> 21:35.511
Fine, walk home, in the rain,
you stupid bitch!

21:38.949 --> 21:41.169
- And, Kendall, we ain't over!
- I'm done, James.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.223
So she left,

21:52.398 --> 21:53.877
then what happened?

21:54.051 --> 21:55.966
He followed her
out of the parking lot

21:56.140 --> 21:58.099
and onto Old Quarry Road.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.928
Thank you. No further
questions, Your Honor.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.193
So you saw him walk down
Old Quarry Road?

22:05.802 --> 22:07.500
Yes.

22:07.674 --> 22:08.979
Did you know
that his car was parked

22:09.153 --> 22:10.154
down on Old Quarry Road?

22:11.547 --> 22:12.548
No.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.159
No.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.813
Were you drinking that night?

22:16.987 --> 22:18.162
Objection, Your Honor.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.426
Overruled.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.079
Were you drinking that night?

22:23.124 --> 22:24.473
Yes.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.302
So you don't know
how far he followed her

22:27.476 --> 22:30.827
down Old Quarry Road, do you?

22:31.001 --> 22:32.568
No. Um, at that point,

22:32.742 --> 22:34.962
I had stopped filming
and I went back inside.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.400
No more questions.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.968
Does the State
have any more questions?

22:41.142 --> 22:42.535
No more questions, Your Honor.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.150
Thank you.
You may step down.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.718
I was at the bar till close.

22:51.892 --> 22:54.547
I didn't see either one of them
come back in.

22:54.721 --> 22:55.939
And then the next day,
I opened,

22:56.113 --> 22:57.463
and I did what I always do.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.943
I took the night's trash
out to the dumpster.

23:03.556 --> 23:06.515
Miss! Miss!
I'm sorry. I need your help.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.562
Because of the rain
the night before...

23:09.736 --> 23:11.868
<i>the trails were
all muddy and wet.</i>

23:15.176 --> 23:17.004
<i>So I had to cut up
to Old Quarry by the bridge</i>

23:17.178 --> 23:18.745
<i>in order to get back
to the road.</i>

23:36.937 --> 23:38.199
Right. And just to be clear,

23:38.373 --> 23:40.201
when you found Kendall Carter,

23:41.028 --> 23:42.246
she was dead?

23:44.597 --> 23:47.295
Her head was
in a pool of blood.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.602
It was awful.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.302
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Reed.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.608
I know it isn't easy.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.132
That's all I have.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.136
Mr. Resnick, your witness.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.226
Mr. Reed,

24:05.400 --> 24:08.055
you hike those trails
in the woods frequently,
don't you?

24:09.317 --> 24:10.361
Yes, sir.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.233
Twice a week at least.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.888
In your opinion, is the hike
down the hillside difficult?

24:15.671 --> 24:17.412
Yes.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.370
I assume you wear hiking boots

24:19.545 --> 24:21.068
when you hike, Mr. Reed?
Is that correct?

24:23.070 --> 24:24.375
Of course.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.596
This is a picture
of Kendall Carter

24:27.770 --> 24:31.426
the morning you found her
below Old Quarry Road.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.950
Can you please tell us
what kind of shoes
she's wearing?

24:37.127 --> 24:38.172
Looks like heels.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.219
Heels.

24:42.393 --> 24:45.048
And if she's walking along
the edge of Old Quarry Road

24:45.222 --> 24:49.662
in a blinding rainstorm
at night, in heels,

24:49.836 --> 24:52.882
and she suddenly
lost her footing,

24:53.056 --> 24:54.841
it'd be next to impossible

24:55.015 --> 24:56.799
to prevent herself
from falling,
isn't that correct?

24:59.759 --> 25:00.629
Yes.

25:03.806 --> 25:04.720
Thank you.

25:06.766 --> 25:09.072
She landed
in a posterior position,

25:09.246 --> 25:12.859
which suggests she was pushed,
as opposed to a fall.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.252
Rigor mortis indicated
the victim had been dead

25:15.426 --> 25:16.950
for around nine hours.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.255
Hmm.

25:18.429 --> 25:19.822
And the cause of death?

25:19.996 --> 25:22.129
The severity of her
skull fractures suggests

25:22.303 --> 25:25.306
she was struck
with a non-specific
blunt instrument.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.657
And the manner of death?

25:29.876 --> 25:30.833
Homicide.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.011
Thank you.
No more questions.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.974
The witness is yours,
Mr. Resnick.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.063
Is it possible
that she sustained

25:43.237 --> 25:45.195
her head injuries
from hitting the rocks?

25:45.369 --> 25:47.110
Possible, sure,

25:47.284 --> 25:48.329
but in my
professional opinion,
it's not likely.

25:48.503 --> 25:49.983
But possible.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.030
That's all from me.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.821
Thank you for your testimony.
You may step down.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.696
On October 25th of last year,

26:07.870 --> 26:09.219
you lived on Old Quarry Road.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.352
- Correct?
- Yes.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.136
And do you remember
anything unusual happening
that evening?

26:13.310 --> 26:16.444
I saw a man get out of his car
in a storm.

26:16.618 --> 26:17.837
Do you remember
what time that was?

26:18.011 --> 26:20.100
It was 11:48 on the button.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.102
I looked at the clock.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.670
I heard thunder,

26:24.844 --> 26:27.107
and so I went to the window,
and lightning lit up the sky.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.500
<i>There he was.</i>

26:29.675 --> 26:31.241
What was he doing?

26:31.415 --> 26:34.593
He looked around, he went over
to the side of the road.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.598
Peered over the railing...

26:39.772 --> 26:43.471
got back in his car
and drove off.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.994
And is that man
you saw that night

26:45.168 --> 26:46.474
here in the courtroom
today, do you know?

26:46.648 --> 26:47.693
Can you point him out?

26:52.959 --> 26:54.177
Yes, he is here today.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.355
That's him right there.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.619
Let the record reflect that
the witness has identified

27:00.793 --> 27:02.751
the man he saw
as the defendant,

27:02.925 --> 27:05.624
James Michael Sythe.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.103
No more questions, Your Honor.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.238
All right. This feels
like a good time

27:11.412 --> 27:13.457
to break for the day.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.722
This court is in recess until
9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning

27:16.896 --> 27:19.594
when we will pick up here
where we left off.

27:31.824 --> 27:32.825
Justin, what's going on?

27:35.001 --> 27:36.089
I need a lawyer.

27:38.091 --> 27:40.354
Okay. Give me a dollar.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.443
And I'm not joking, that gives
us attorney-client privilege.

27:42.617 --> 27:43.618
Take a seat.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.797
So I went to clear my head,

27:48.971 --> 27:51.278
and found myself
at Rowdy's Hideaway...

27:53.019 --> 27:54.716
Ordered a drink
and sat there for a while,

27:54.890 --> 27:56.370
then I got up and left.

27:56.544 --> 27:59.373
I got to the car.
It was raining.

27:59.547 --> 28:00.940
I turned back onto Old Quarry,

28:01.114 --> 28:03.029
I went about
a quarter of a mile

28:03.203 --> 28:04.508
and I hit something.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.294
I got out of the car
and I looked around.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.817
I checked,
I didn't see anything,

28:08.991 --> 28:11.298
and I figured it was
a deer that ran off,

28:11.472 --> 28:14.214
and then I got back
in the car and went home.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.610
Okay, what's the problem?

28:19.785 --> 28:21.830
I got called for jury duty.

28:22.004 --> 28:24.354
- The Kendall Carter case?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:24.528 --> 28:27.836
And they found her body
in a creek bed,

28:28.010 --> 28:30.709
about a quarter mile from
Rowdy's Hideaway last October.

28:33.755 --> 28:34.930
What are you telling me?

28:38.455 --> 28:39.718
Maybe I didn't hit a deer.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.245
I don't know
what to do.

28:47.334 --> 28:48.639
You were at a bar
and you had a drink?

28:48.814 --> 28:50.250
Yes, but I didn't touch it.

28:50.424 --> 28:51.512
Doesn't matter.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.861
Given your history,

28:53.035 --> 28:54.341
there isn't a jury in the world

28:54.515 --> 28:55.995
that would believe
you were sober.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.605
But if I was
coming forward voluntarily,

28:57.779 --> 28:59.215
that has to count
for something, right?

28:59.389 --> 29:00.477
If I come forward
and I tell them the truth...

29:00.651 --> 29:01.870
Then your prior DUIs,

29:02.044 --> 29:03.524
and the fact
that you were at a bar,

29:03.698 --> 29:04.873
gives the State
reason to charge you

29:05.047 --> 29:06.353
with first-degree
vehicular homicide

29:06.527 --> 29:07.528
or even felony murder.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.443
That's 30 years to life.

29:09.617 --> 29:10.879
What?

29:11.053 --> 29:12.402
If you were to
come forward right now,

29:12.576 --> 29:13.926
you will be completely screwed.

29:16.493 --> 29:17.407
That's it?

29:17.581 --> 29:18.582
Uh...

29:22.935 --> 29:23.892
I'm sorry.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.115
The defense calls
James Sythe, Your Honor.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.816
Please raise
your right hand.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.600
Do you swear to tell the truth,

29:36.775 --> 29:38.864
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

29:39.038 --> 29:40.039
so help you God?

29:40.213 --> 29:41.344
Yes, Your Honor.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.738
All right. Have a seat.

29:47.046 --> 29:49.265
Please state your name
for the record.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.137
Uh, James Michael Sythe.

29:53.530 --> 29:54.967
Mr. Resnick, your witness.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.447
Okay, James, let's talk
about what happened

29:57.621 --> 29:58.971
the night of October 25th.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.233
Can you tell us what happened?

30:00.407 --> 30:02.148
Yeah, um...

30:02.322 --> 30:03.714
Kendall and I went to Rowdy's

30:03.889 --> 30:06.369
to have a few drinks,
get some food.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.764
We were having fun,
shots and pool,

30:09.938 --> 30:12.114
played some darts, you know.

30:12.288 --> 30:15.465
Now, there's been testimony
that you guys argued.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.685
You don't deny that, do you?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.861
No. No, yeah. Um...

30:20.035 --> 30:22.646
She got really drunk
and she was...

30:22.821 --> 30:23.822
She was giving me a hard time.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.607
What do you mean?

30:26.781 --> 30:29.088
She'd been going on
about us moving in together

30:29.262 --> 30:30.872
for a couple of weeks and I...

30:31.046 --> 30:32.569
<i>just kept telling her
that I didn't think</i>

30:32.743 --> 30:34.267
<i>that I was ready.</i>

30:34.441 --> 30:35.398
We'll... We'll see.

30:37.183 --> 30:39.141
- We'll see.
- What do you mean "We'll see"?

30:39.315 --> 30:41.665
And she just wasn't having it.
She said I didn't love her.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.104
And, uh, she stormed out.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.583
And then what happened?

30:47.802 --> 30:49.804
We argued in the parking lot.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.327
I don't want
to do this anymore.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.286
- Do what?
- I want to go home.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.288
I'm done.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.767
Fine. Get out of here.
Go walk home.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.120
Go walk home then. In the rain.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.169
<i>And she was just
out of her head, you know?</i>

31:07.343 --> 31:09.606
<i>Screaming at me and walked off.</i>

31:10.781 --> 31:12.827
<i>And what did you do?</i>

31:13.001 --> 31:14.785
<i>Followed her, at first,</i>

31:14.960 --> 31:17.353
<i>but it was cold,
it was raining.</i>

31:18.702 --> 31:20.704
I remember getting in my car.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.271
So I was parked next to, uh,

31:22.445 --> 31:23.969
<i>mile marker 217.</i>

31:27.276 --> 31:30.889
<i>My niece is born
February 17th, so that just...</i>

31:33.195 --> 31:35.241
<i>I don't know, pulled me
out of everything,</i>

31:35.415 --> 31:37.939
<i>then I turned around
and just drove home.</i>

31:44.990 --> 31:47.862
And, um, we'd see
each other the next day,

31:48.036 --> 31:49.559
and we'd work it out, like...

31:51.083 --> 31:52.040
like always.

31:54.042 --> 31:57.567
Look, was I stupid?

31:57.741 --> 32:00.222
For not wanting
to move in with her?

32:00.396 --> 32:02.224
So I could see
her face every day?

32:04.270 --> 32:05.184
Absolutely, yeah.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.362
But I could never put
my hands on her like that.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.281
I couldn't do that to her.

32:16.369 --> 32:17.544
I... I loved her.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.984
Now, look, I understand,

32:23.158 --> 32:26.161
with my past,
and the mistakes
that I've made,

32:26.335 --> 32:28.772
I know what you're thinking,
I do. And I get it.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.255
But I'm...

32:33.429 --> 32:35.083
I'm not that guy anymore.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.433
Okay, I've changed.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.437
I left that life behind me,
and I, you know...

32:41.611 --> 32:43.265
I thought
I was doing really good.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.878
I don't know
what happened.

32:48.836 --> 32:49.880
I went home. I drove...

32:50.055 --> 32:51.273
I just... I drove home.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.847
I know how difficult
this is for you, James.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.807
You take your time, and...

33:03.982 --> 33:05.331
let me know when you're ready.

33:07.246 --> 33:08.203
I'm good.

33:10.727 --> 33:13.121
I'm gonna show you
a video now, okay?

33:13.295 --> 33:14.905
And then I'm gonna
ask you some questions.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.084
<i>It's fine. I'm not mad.</i>

33:19.258 --> 33:20.781
<i>Why didn't you say it to me?</i>

33:26.395 --> 33:27.918
<i>Did you see that?</i>

33:28.093 --> 33:29.616
<i>- That's for you.</i>
-  <i>That's my guy.</i>

33:32.445 --> 33:34.621
<i>- I love you.
- I love you, too.</i>

33:34.795 --> 33:35.883
<i>Did you miss or make it?</i>

33:36.057 --> 33:36.884
<i>No, I didn't make it.</i>

33:37.058 --> 33:38.712
<i>You missed it.</i>

33:38.886 --> 33:41.106
<i>Well, let me help you.
You're good luck. Come here.</i>

33:41.889 --> 33:42.846
<i>I was.</i>

33:50.245 --> 33:51.638
<i>Okay,
turn that shit off.</i>

33:51.812 --> 33:52.987
<i>Okay.</i>

33:56.773 --> 33:57.731
Who took that video?

33:58.688 --> 33:59.689
Kendall.

34:01.691 --> 34:02.605
When?

34:02.779 --> 34:04.085
October 25th.

34:05.304 --> 34:06.261
Of last year.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.046
And where?

34:09.351 --> 34:11.092
At Rowdy's Hideaway.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.489
Thank you, James.
No more questions.

34:20.449 --> 34:21.929
Prosecution, your witness.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.192
Mr. Sythe,

34:24.366 --> 34:27.065
you just stated that
you loved Kendall Carter.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.023
Is that right?

34:29.197 --> 34:31.243
- More than anything.
-  Hmm.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.027
And on the night
of October 25th,

34:33.201 --> 34:34.768
you and Kendall drove
to Rowdy's Hideaway.

34:34.942 --> 34:35.812
Is that right?

34:35.986 --> 34:38.424
We took my car, yeah.

34:38.598 --> 34:39.686
And when you got there,
the two of you

34:39.860 --> 34:41.079
started drinking,
is that right?

34:42.254 --> 34:44.343
Yeah. It's a bar.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.301
And then the two of you
started arguing.

34:46.475 --> 34:47.476
Is that right?

34:48.260 --> 34:49.087
Yeah.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.046
And during this argument,

34:52.220 --> 34:54.483
you knocked a beer bottle
off the table.

34:54.657 --> 34:55.745
Is that right?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.358
Yeah, it was an accident.

34:59.532 --> 35:02.491
And then she left,
and you went after her.

35:02.665 --> 35:03.492
Is that right?

35:03.666 --> 35:05.233
Yeah.

35:05.407 --> 35:08.845
And outside, the argument
continued, and...

35:09.019 --> 35:11.109
it is your sworn testimony,

35:11.283 --> 35:13.502
that you left
Kendall Carter alone

35:13.676 --> 35:15.896
to walk down
a narrow two-lane road

35:16.070 --> 35:18.942
in the dark, drunk,
in the pouring rain,

35:19.117 --> 35:20.988
in the middle
of a thunderstorm.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.992
Is that how you treat
someone you love?

35:29.910 --> 35:31.129
No more questions, Your Honor.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.221
Are there any further questions
from the defense?

35:36.395 --> 35:39.398
No, Your Honor.
The defense rests.

35:39.572 --> 35:42.401
Thank you for your testimony,
you can step down.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.628
Members of the jury,

35:52.802 --> 35:54.891
the evidence in this case
is now closed.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.371
Attorneys, you may give

35:56.545 --> 35:58.721
your closing arguments
at this time.

35:58.895 --> 36:00.941
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

36:02.899 --> 36:06.468
Kendall Carter's murder
was a savage crime

36:06.642 --> 36:08.470
committed by an evil man.

36:09.602 --> 36:11.299
<i>An innocent man.</i>

36:11.473 --> 36:15.085
An innocent man
who was shattered

36:15.260 --> 36:18.654
from losing
the love of his life.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.830
We have an eyewitness
who saw him at the crime scene

36:21.004 --> 36:23.093
at the time of death.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.358
In the middle of the night,
in a blinding rainstorm...

36:27.446 --> 36:28.751
it could have been anyone.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.753
When she broke up
with him that night,

36:30.927 --> 36:33.321
and he realized she meant it,

36:33.495 --> 36:34.540
he snapped.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.543
And so he bludgeoned her.

36:37.717 --> 36:40.981
No murder weapon
was recovered. Nothing.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.157
Nothing.

36:43.331 --> 36:46.247
The defendant's DNA
was all over the victim.

36:46.421 --> 36:47.640
No one else's.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.424
The State says
there was DNA.

36:49.598 --> 36:52.035
Of course, there was DNA.
Of course.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.559
They were a couple.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.039
Yeah, of course,
they were a couple.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.737
Until they weren't.

36:57.911 --> 37:01.871
James Sythe bravely
took the stand

37:02.045 --> 37:04.483
and admitted
to some difficult truths.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.049
That?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.922
That was all a performance,
nothing else.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.446
Look...

37:11.620 --> 37:14.754
I think we can
all agree on this.

37:14.928 --> 37:18.105
The person responsible
for Kendall Carter's death

37:19.106 --> 37:20.716
deserves to face justice.

37:21.848 --> 37:24.067
That person is James Sythe.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.331
But that person,

37:27.462 --> 37:28.681
that evil man,

37:29.943 --> 37:31.205
is still out there.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.210
All I ask is that you
deliver a verdict

37:36.384 --> 37:37.690
that speaks the truth.

37:39.213 --> 37:42.042
The truth about
what happened to Kendall.

37:42.216 --> 37:44.827
The truth about what happened
on Old Quarry Road that night.

37:46.438 --> 37:47.917
And the truth about him.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.009
And the truth about him...

37:54.315 --> 37:56.230
is that James Michael Sythe

37:57.318 --> 37:58.276
is guilty.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.930
Find him guilty.

38:02.932 --> 38:05.457
The truth is, James Sythe...

38:06.327 --> 38:08.155
is not guilty.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.681
Find James Sythe...

38:14.204 --> 38:15.293
not guilty.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.079
Thank you.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.521
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

38:26.695 --> 38:27.870
Um, excuse me, everyone.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.829
If... If nobody objects,

38:30.003 --> 38:32.179
I'd really like to throw
my name into the ring

38:32.353 --> 38:33.398
to be the forewoman.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.834
I've served on multiple juries.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.270
- I know the ropes.
- I'm cool with it.

38:36.444 --> 38:37.663
- Yeah. Sure.
- Sure!

38:37.837 --> 38:39.404
- I don't mind.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

38:39.578 --> 38:43.016
Okay. So right now we can do
one of two things.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.670
We can vote and talk,

38:44.844 --> 38:46.149
or talk and vote.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.803
I suggest that we just vote

38:47.977 --> 38:49.414
and just get an idea
where we all stand.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.111
- Does that sound good?
- Agreed.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.940
Okay. So I vote "guilty."

38:54.114 --> 38:56.551
Yes, ma'am. Me, too.

38:56.725 --> 39:00.990
Me three. This whole thing
is such a shame.

39:01.164 --> 39:03.863
Yeah. I definitely think
that he did it.

39:04.037 --> 39:04.994
Definitely.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.214
I agree.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.651
Everything fits together.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.437
Yeah. Let him rot.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.440
Amen.

39:15.614 --> 39:19.182
Nine. So that is
nine for guilty.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.316
You, sir? Hi.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.405
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, guilty's cool.

39:25.667 --> 39:26.625
Okay.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.453
And...

39:28.627 --> 39:30.280
Oh! You, sir? How about you?

39:30.455 --> 39:32.108
Kid should have pled out.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.938
And then there was one.

39:47.559 --> 39:49.778
All right. So...
what's it gonna be?

39:49.952 --> 39:51.258
You with us or what?

39:54.479 --> 39:56.002
Tsk.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.615
Don't you want to get home
to your pregnant wife?

40:00.789 --> 40:01.964
Of... Of course I do.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.357
All right.
So what's the problem?

40:06.055 --> 40:07.230
You know, this is somebody's
life we're dealing with.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.537
Shouldn't we at least
talk about it?

40:12.453 --> 40:14.629
This is a joke.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.718
No, it's, um...
Look, it's a deliberation.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.938
You are ready to send
this man to prison,

40:19.112 --> 40:20.461
maybe forever, just like that?

40:20.635 --> 40:22.724
And?

40:22.898 --> 40:24.334
I heard the facts
of the case. Did you?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.511
Yeah, right.
The lawyer didn't prove,

40:26.685 --> 40:29.296
beyond a reasonable doubt,
that he was innocent.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.863
Well, he doesn't have to.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.952
The burden of proof
is on the prosecution.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.345
Does anyone have
even the slightest hesitation

40:35.520 --> 40:36.782
that James Sythe is guilty?

40:36.956 --> 40:39.828
I mean...

40:40.002 --> 40:41.874
Look, if you have to think,
you aren't sure.

40:42.048 --> 40:43.441
No.

40:43.615 --> 40:45.312
What I'm sure of is,
I got three kids at home

40:45.486 --> 40:46.487
I got to get back to.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.010
Look, we all have lives.

40:48.184 --> 40:49.098
None of us want to be here.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.187
Okay. Um, how about we...

40:51.361 --> 40:53.581
Why don't you just tell us
what your issue is

40:53.755 --> 40:55.627
or your issues are,

40:55.801 --> 40:57.498
and... and then we can
all talk through it?

40:57.672 --> 41:00.545
Oh, I don't have
an... an issue. Uh...

41:00.719 --> 41:02.285
Okay. So you just like
pissing me off, then?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.331
- Or what?
-  No. Look, I...

41:04.505 --> 41:05.767
I have questions.

41:05.941 --> 41:08.596
Nah. That's just
your guilt talking.

41:09.989 --> 41:10.903
What do you mean?

41:14.515 --> 41:16.952
You want to go home
to your little neighborhood

41:17.126 --> 41:18.301
and tell them,

41:18.476 --> 41:20.042
"We did right by that boy.

41:20.216 --> 41:23.393
We gave him a fair shake,
just like anybody else."

41:23.568 --> 41:25.831
Whoa, man. Hold up.
Why're you getting on him
like that?

41:26.005 --> 41:27.006
Hey, mind
your own damn business,

41:27.180 --> 41:28.529
all right, little fella?

41:28.703 --> 41:30.662
- Excuse me?
- That's enough. Both of you.

41:33.142 --> 41:35.318
Please, Mr. Kemp, go on.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.494
Thank you, ma'am.

41:37.799 --> 41:39.235
All I'm trying to say is,

41:39.409 --> 41:40.759
let's put everything else
aside for a minute

41:40.933 --> 41:43.501
and just remember
two key points. Um...

41:43.675 --> 41:45.938
One, Sythe went to trial
instead of taking a plea,

41:46.112 --> 41:48.984
and two, he testified
instead of taking the Fifth.

41:50.029 --> 41:51.465
Right? I mean...

41:51.639 --> 41:53.206
it doesn't mean he's innocent,

41:53.380 --> 41:54.642
but I think he's earned
just a few hours of our time

41:54.816 --> 41:56.383
just to be sure.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.777
Uh, he's right. You're right.

41:58.951 --> 42:01.214
We should take the time
and we should go over it.

42:01.388 --> 42:04.260
Fine. Fine,
but it's a waste of time.

42:04.434 --> 42:05.827
Any other group of 12 people

42:06.001 --> 42:07.350
would arrive at the exact same
decision we did.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.049
Mmm-hmm.
That part right there.

42:11.659 --> 42:14.575
The State has the truth
on its side.

42:14.749 --> 42:17.099
James Sythe is going to pay
for what he did.

42:17.273 --> 42:19.449
And I will get justice
for Kendall Carter

42:19.624 --> 42:23.192
and every woman who is
a victim of domestic abuse.

42:23.366 --> 42:24.977
How do you feel
about the latest polling

42:25.151 --> 42:26.848
that a verdict
in the Sythe trial

42:27.022 --> 42:28.633
carries a five-point swing
in the district attorney race?

42:28.807 --> 42:29.851
Oh, come on. You...

42:30.025 --> 42:31.766
You know I can't
comment on that.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.507
Okay. Thank you, everybody.

42:40.253 --> 42:44.649
So I'm just going to start
with what I think

42:44.823 --> 42:47.173
is the most damning evidence.

42:47.347 --> 42:50.176
Which was the man who saw

42:50.350 --> 42:53.048
Sythe on the road,
at the railing,

42:53.222 --> 42:55.398
directly above where
Kendall Carter's
body was found.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.096
Yes, exactly.

42:57.270 --> 42:58.750
So what's left
to even talk about?

42:58.924 --> 43:00.534
Well, I mean, he was
a few hundred feet away,

43:00.708 --> 43:01.840
looking from across the bridge.

43:02.014 --> 43:03.755
And it was
the middle of the night,

43:03.929 --> 43:05.583
and through pouring rain.

43:05.757 --> 43:07.019
Yeah. And I've actually done

43:07.193 --> 43:08.455
a bunch of landscaping
work up there.

43:08.629 --> 43:10.500
That whole area
is covered by trees.

43:10.675 --> 43:11.980
It'd be hard to see.

43:12.154 --> 43:14.374
The man made
a positive identification.

43:14.548 --> 43:16.724
Yeah, but dude's
kind of ancient, though.

43:18.683 --> 43:22.164
Well, this old bird has
20-20 vision with my glasses.

43:22.338 --> 43:24.863
Come on, y'all.
It's his testimony.
He's not lying.

43:25.037 --> 43:26.691
I mean, why would he lie?

43:26.865 --> 43:28.344
And the question here means
that we think he's lying.

43:28.518 --> 43:29.911
I don't think he's lying.

43:30.085 --> 43:31.043
You think he's lying?

43:31.217 --> 43:32.784
No, I don't think he's lying--

43:32.958 --> 43:33.872
Okay. So what
the hell are we talking about?

43:34.046 --> 43:35.438
Look, I'm just saying... Okay.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.440
The man, he saw somebody
at the railing, right?

43:37.615 --> 43:38.616
Can we all agree on that?

43:38.790 --> 43:39.660
- Yeah.
- Yes.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.444
Okay. So isn't it possible

43:41.619 --> 43:43.490
- that he saw someone
other than James Sythe?
- Oh!

43:43.664 --> 43:45.971
Mmm-mmm.
No, we can go back and forth
all day on possibilities.

43:46.145 --> 43:47.450
That's not helpful.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.321
- Well, I think we should.
- No, no, no.

43:48.495 --> 43:49.670
No. That's not our job.

43:49.844 --> 43:51.324
Our job is to just
weigh the facts.

43:52.542 --> 43:54.588
Okay. Fact.

43:54.762 --> 43:58.070
32% of homicides occur
between domestic partners.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.985
Fact, the police
arrested James Sythe

44:00.159 --> 44:01.813
two days after
they found the body.

44:01.987 --> 44:04.946
Fact, they never questioned
any other suspects.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.905
You watch too much TV,
old man.

44:08.602 --> 44:10.952
Okay.

44:17.045 --> 44:18.177
You're a cop?

44:19.961 --> 44:21.310
I was.

44:21.484 --> 44:23.530
Twenty-two years.
Robbery-homicide.

44:25.445 --> 44:27.577
Finally took the buyout,
came down here to get away

44:27.752 --> 44:29.623
from those brutal
Midwest winters

44:29.797 --> 44:31.364
and be closer to the grandkids.

44:31.538 --> 44:33.366
Why didn't you... Why didn't
you tell the lawyers?

44:33.540 --> 44:34.846
'Cause nobody asked.

44:35.020 --> 44:36.848
How about that.

44:37.022 --> 44:39.328
Well, their loss is our gain.

44:39.502 --> 44:41.287
So what are you
thinking, officer?

44:41.461 --> 44:42.767
Uh, Detective.

44:42.941 --> 44:43.942
Um...

44:44.116 --> 44:45.639
Look, I think...

44:45.813 --> 44:47.293
It seems to me like the police,

44:47.467 --> 44:48.860
you know, followed
the evidence,

44:49.034 --> 44:50.775
found their guy,
built their case.

44:50.949 --> 44:52.864
Okay. So what's wrong
with that?

44:53.038 --> 44:54.909
It may be nothing,
but tunnel vision like that

44:55.083 --> 44:56.824
can really bite you in the ass.

44:56.998 --> 44:58.957
They feed Sythe
to that eyewitness,

44:59.131 --> 45:01.220
so, of course,
that's who he IDs.

45:01.394 --> 45:03.135
Now they're sure
they got their guy,

45:03.309 --> 45:05.485
so they just ignore anything
that doesn't help their case.

45:05.659 --> 45:08.140
They stop asking questions.

45:08.314 --> 45:09.663
Confirmation bias.

45:09.837 --> 45:11.621
Yeah, confirmation bias.
Exactly.

45:11.796 --> 45:12.797
Confirmation bias.

45:12.971 --> 45:14.712
There's no bad intentions.

45:14.886 --> 45:17.453
It's just a bunch of people
trying to do the right thing,

45:17.627 --> 45:20.761
and they can't see everything
they're doing wrong.

45:20.935 --> 45:23.198
It's a good point.

45:23.372 --> 45:26.724
And what about this blunt
instrument murder weapon

45:26.898 --> 45:28.377
they kept talking about?

45:28.551 --> 45:31.119
The prosecutor said
they couldn't recover it.

45:31.293 --> 45:33.426
So he got rid of it.
That's easy to do.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.949
Or he could have killed her

45:35.123 --> 45:37.647
with something other
than a blunt instrument.

45:37.822 --> 45:38.823
Like what?

45:40.433 --> 45:42.652
Like a car?

45:42.827 --> 45:44.089
It could have been
a hit-and-run.

45:46.221 --> 45:47.527
Oh, shit.

45:47.701 --> 45:48.920
- Here. Let me help.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

45:49.094 --> 45:49.790
- It got in your pants.
- It's all right.

45:49.964 --> 45:51.183
You know, that's...

45:51.357 --> 45:53.402
That's a really, really
good theory.

45:53.576 --> 45:55.187
- Hit-and-run.
-  Yeah.

45:55.361 --> 45:56.536
I mean, it's raining,
it's night.

45:56.710 --> 45:58.451
Visibility's
got to be terrible.

45:58.625 --> 46:01.106
Well, we know it was slippery,
from that hiker's testimony.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.935
Wandering around
in the dark in heels?

46:04.109 --> 46:06.328
Kids today...

46:06.502 --> 46:10.506
Um, it explains how she could
have ended up in a creek.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.552
Mmm-hmm.

46:12.726 --> 46:15.860
Okay. So, Sythe mowed her down
instead of bashing her head in?

46:16.034 --> 46:17.339
What are we talking about here?

46:17.513 --> 46:18.645
What difference does it make?

46:18.819 --> 46:21.213
The guy is a piece of shit.

46:21.387 --> 46:25.521
Look, my gut is telling me
that that kid is not a killer.

46:25.695 --> 46:28.002
- Okay. The other day,
you voted guilty.
-  Mmm-hmm.

46:28.176 --> 46:30.004
No. No, I never said guilty.

46:30.178 --> 46:32.964
I said, he should have
taken a plea bargain.

46:33.138 --> 46:34.748
He's got a weak case.

46:34.922 --> 46:36.619
Well, maybe there's
a reason for that.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.448
Yeah. It's called
a public defender.

46:39.622 --> 46:40.667
I mean,
nothing against this guy.

46:40.841 --> 46:42.060
He seems pretty smart,

46:42.234 --> 46:44.976
but... the PDs
are working 10 times

46:45.150 --> 46:48.544
the caseload of the DA's office
on a fraction of the budget.

46:48.718 --> 46:50.155
It's just not a fair fight.

46:50.329 --> 46:52.635
Yeah, well, nothing is anymore.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.333
We'll just do the best we can.

46:54.507 --> 46:55.464
I hear you.

46:57.162 --> 46:59.120
And I got 22 years
on the street,

46:59.294 --> 47:01.035
that is telling me

47:01.209 --> 47:03.733
there's a lot more
to this case than we know.

47:03.908 --> 47:06.345
All right. Then, if you were
still a detective,

47:06.519 --> 47:07.476
what would you do?

47:07.650 --> 47:09.739
Yeah.

47:09.914 --> 47:12.481
All right, y'all.
That's it for today.

47:12.655 --> 47:16.529
See you back here at 9:00 a.m.
Monday morning.

47:16.703 --> 47:18.966
Oh! And I almost forgot.
Happy Halloween.

47:19.140 --> 47:20.881
Happy Halloween!

47:23.231 --> 47:24.145
Hey!

47:24.319 --> 47:26.234
Yeah, it has been a minute.

47:26.408 --> 47:28.497
But I was hoping
you could do me a solid.

47:29.629 --> 47:30.630
Hang on a sec.

47:35.983 --> 47:37.115
Yeah, I'm here.

47:54.567 --> 47:56.003
"We cannot break the law.

47:56.177 --> 47:58.876
"We can only break ourselves
of the law."

48:02.880 --> 48:03.968
No decision yet.

48:04.142 --> 48:05.404
We're breaking for the weekend.

48:05.578 --> 48:07.145
You're kidding.

48:07.319 --> 48:08.973
You never know what
a dozen strangers are gonna do.

48:09.147 --> 48:10.975
Clearly. Okay. Well,
thanks for letting me know.

48:11.149 --> 48:12.411
- See you Monday.
- Mmm-hmm.

48:12.585 --> 48:14.456
- Trick or treat!
- Yeah. Have a good one.

49:20.261 --> 49:21.697
Hey, hon.

49:21.871 --> 49:24.874
Yeah, I'm heading back
to the shop right now.

49:25.701 --> 49:26.702
Okay.

49:56.819 --> 49:58.430
Hey.

49:58.604 --> 50:00.345
- Hi.
- Did you get my text?

50:02.869 --> 50:04.001
Oh, shit.

50:04.175 --> 50:05.350
Sorry.

50:06.394 --> 50:08.005
I'm sorry, I forgot.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.268
Does everything look okay?

50:12.748 --> 50:13.706
Are you okay?

50:20.060 --> 50:21.627
Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

50:21.801 --> 50:22.802
I'm scared.

50:24.847 --> 50:27.372
I'm scared. We didn't make it
this far last time, and...

50:28.068 --> 50:29.026
I'm just scared.

50:30.853 --> 50:32.203
I don't want to be
doing this alone.

50:32.377 --> 50:33.769
I don't want to go
to these things alone.

50:35.075 --> 50:36.642
It's going to be okay.

50:36.816 --> 50:38.209
It's going
to be all right, I promise.

50:38.383 --> 50:39.123
I don't understand why
you weren't there today.

50:42.735 --> 50:45.520
How much longer is the trial
going to go on for?

50:45.694 --> 50:48.654
I have no idea.

50:48.828 --> 50:50.960
- It's...
- Are you close to a verdict?

50:51.135 --> 50:52.571
I'm not supposed
to discuss the case--

50:52.745 --> 50:54.355
Justin, are you close
to a verdict?

50:54.529 --> 50:57.402
Well, it's ten to two
for guilty.

50:59.534 --> 51:00.970
So then, Monday,

51:01.145 --> 51:02.885
can you just go in
and sway the two holdouts

51:03.060 --> 51:04.713
and then be done with this?

51:04.887 --> 51:07.760
Well, I'm one of them. I...

51:09.588 --> 51:11.372
- Why?
- I'm sorry,

51:11.546 --> 51:12.808
but they took
one look at this guy,
and that was it.

51:12.982 --> 51:14.680
No discussion of
the evidence, nothing.

51:14.854 --> 51:15.855
I had to do something.

51:19.163 --> 51:20.686
Everyone deserves
a chance, right?

51:22.601 --> 51:24.907
I keep thinking where I'd be
if you hadn't given me one.

51:30.435 --> 51:32.089
Can I ask
you something?

51:34.091 --> 51:36.615
Yeah, sure. What?

51:36.789 --> 51:38.878
If I were to sell the 4Runner
without telling someone

51:39.052 --> 51:40.793
it was in a wreck,

51:40.967 --> 51:42.577
but they're happy with the deal
and there's no safety risks.

51:42.751 --> 51:44.536
- It was in the ad, Justin.
- I know, I know,

51:44.710 --> 51:45.885
but just go with me.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.974
If they're never the wiser,

51:48.148 --> 51:50.194
then did I do anything wrong?

51:50.803 --> 51:51.760
No.

51:52.979 --> 51:54.285
I mean, I don't think so.

51:55.895 --> 51:56.896
Yeah.

51:59.594 --> 52:00.682
I'm going upstairs.

52:03.772 --> 52:04.947
Food's in the fridge.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.384
See you upstairs.

52:32.932 --> 52:35.587
There she is.
Next round's on her.

52:35.761 --> 52:37.632
Bourbon. Neat. And...

52:37.806 --> 52:39.068
yeah, whatever he's having.

52:39.243 --> 52:42.594
What I'm having?
What I'm having is a...

52:42.768 --> 52:43.856
- Thank you.
- ...great evening.

52:44.030 --> 52:45.466
Isn't it a beautiful evening?

52:45.640 --> 52:47.555
It should have been
a two-hour verdict.

52:47.729 --> 52:49.775
What can I tell you?
They're taking
their job seriously.

52:49.949 --> 52:51.342
I gave them a lot
to think about.

52:51.516 --> 52:53.822
Mmm. I got a mountain
of evidence.

52:53.996 --> 52:55.563
You gave them
smoke and mirrors.

52:55.737 --> 52:57.174
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

52:57.348 --> 53:01.221
I admire
your optimism.

53:01.395 --> 53:02.918
Look, here's the thing.
You walk into court

53:03.092 --> 53:06.748
convinced of the guilt
of the defendant. Me, I...

53:06.922 --> 53:08.272
I have no illusions
about what I do.

53:08.446 --> 53:10.099
A lot of my clients are guilty,

53:10.274 --> 53:13.015
and my job is to help make
the best of a bad situation.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.104
But I'm telling you...

53:15.279 --> 53:17.194
I'm telling you,
this guy didn't do it.

53:20.197 --> 53:23.548
And the fact that the jury's
taking a little time

53:23.722 --> 53:25.202
gives me hope
that things are working

53:25.376 --> 53:26.594
the way they should.

53:28.205 --> 53:32.034
Well... you enjoy that
while it lasts.

53:35.212 --> 53:38.084
To the justice system.

53:38.258 --> 53:41.218
It ain't perfect,
but it's the best we got.

53:51.706 --> 53:53.012
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:53.186 --> 53:54.970
I'm sorry again
about yesterday.

53:55.144 --> 53:56.537
It's just that case
wearing on me.

53:57.625 --> 53:58.800
I know. I can tell.

53:58.974 --> 54:00.715
- Yeah.
- Trust your gut.

54:00.889 --> 54:02.326
You'll do the right thing.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.849
Oh! Oh, Oh, wait.

54:04.023 --> 54:05.198
Wait, wait, wait.

54:09.463 --> 54:11.335
- What's that?
- It's my pitchfork.

54:11.509 --> 54:13.075
- Nice!
- Yeah. Thanks.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.512
Homemade.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.517
-  Trick or treat!
- Hey! Happy Halloween!

54:19.691 --> 54:22.215
I love your costumes!
Take two, everyone.

54:24.348 --> 54:25.218
Oliver?

54:25.392 --> 54:27.002
Hey, Ms. Crewson.

54:27.176 --> 54:29.918
Oliver, I didn't even
recognize you! How are you?

54:30.092 --> 54:31.485
I'm good. Hi, Mr. Kemp.

54:31.659 --> 54:33.139
Hey, how's the writing going?

54:33.313 --> 54:34.967
- I'm on student paper now.
- No way. That's awesome.

54:35.141 --> 54:36.490
- That's very cool.
- Congrats.

54:36.664 --> 54:38.057
- Hey, have fun tonight.
-  We will.

54:38.231 --> 54:39.363
See you back at school?

54:39.537 --> 54:40.886
- Yeah. Next year.
-  Okay.

54:41.060 --> 54:42.366
Well, bye.

54:42.540 --> 54:44.106
- Bye!
- Keep it up!

54:44.281 --> 54:46.195
- God, he's a giant.
- I know.

54:46.370 --> 54:47.806
Happy Halloween.

54:52.941 --> 54:53.942
Thanks.

55:06.390 --> 55:07.826
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.698
Why'd you follow me
after court on Friday?

55:10.872 --> 55:12.874
I picked your tail up,
like, halfway out of
the parking lot.

55:13.048 --> 55:15.660
I mean, green Toyota
4Runner, right?

55:15.834 --> 55:17.792
Uh, yeah, well, you're...

55:17.966 --> 55:19.185
you're not allowed
to investigate the case

55:19.359 --> 55:20.534
outside the jury room.

55:21.535 --> 55:23.537
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

55:23.711 --> 55:27.149
But... I mean,
somebody's got to.

55:27.324 --> 55:28.629
Don't you want to know
what really happened?

55:28.803 --> 55:30.457
Yeah. Of course.

55:31.415 --> 55:33.025
Look, I, uh...

55:33.199 --> 55:34.156
I did some digging.

55:36.289 --> 55:38.030
This is every registered car
in the county

55:38.204 --> 55:39.684
that was in for body work

55:39.858 --> 55:41.381
between October 26th
and the end of last year.

55:41.555 --> 55:42.948
You're still about
the hit-and-run?
Come on, it's--

55:43.122 --> 55:44.819
Yeah, because that's
a really good theory.

55:44.993 --> 55:47.648
Now, the automakers
keep a detailed list

55:47.822 --> 55:50.608
of these repairs
strictly for R and D purposes.

55:50.782 --> 55:53.088
They collect it
from the dealers pro forma

55:53.262 --> 55:55.395
and then pay the mom-and-pop
shops under the table.

55:55.569 --> 55:56.788
My partner and I
recovered more cars

55:56.962 --> 55:58.442
than an impound this way.

55:58.616 --> 56:00.792
Right. But there must be
hundreds of cars in there.

56:00.966 --> 56:02.794
Yeah, so process
of elimination,

56:02.968 --> 56:05.666
which is what I spent
my whole weekend doing.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.147
I mean, anything there's
already a police report for,

56:08.321 --> 56:09.235
crossed off the list.

56:09.409 --> 56:11.150
Mmm.

56:11.324 --> 56:12.673
And there's only going to be
a very specific kind of damage

56:12.847 --> 56:13.805
with this kind of hit-and-run.

56:13.979 --> 56:17.025
So a headlight, grille, hood.

56:17.199 --> 56:19.680
- Yeah.
- I narrowed it down
to 15 vehicles

56:19.854 --> 56:21.726
that match that description
on this list,

56:21.900 --> 56:23.205
one of which, by the way,

56:23.380 --> 56:26.339
a '96 Toyota 4Runner,
Forest Green.

56:26.513 --> 56:29.081
I mean, that's the exact
same car as yours, right?

56:29.255 --> 56:30.474
I mean, if that is your car,

56:30.648 --> 56:32.563
we can just cross it
off the list.

56:32.737 --> 56:36.001
Right. Yeah.
So what's the plan?

56:36.175 --> 56:38.220
Well, if you
don't mind helping,

56:38.395 --> 56:39.787
there's only so many
hours in the day,

56:39.961 --> 56:41.310
and we got to spend
most of them here.

56:41.485 --> 56:42.660
So you want to help me
with the legwork,

56:42.834 --> 56:44.270
and see if we can find our guy.

56:44.444 --> 56:46.838
Yeah. Okay. You know,
you're reaching, but...

56:47.012 --> 56:48.361
Look, I...
It's a hit-and-run, kid.

56:48.535 --> 56:49.928
I feel it in my bones.

56:50.102 --> 56:52.147
Dollars to doughnuts,
our guy is on this list.

56:52.321 --> 56:56.021
Oh, good morning.
Party time, y'all, let's go.

56:58.589 --> 56:59.938
Fellas, wrap it up.

57:00.112 --> 57:01.330
Thanks.

57:04.203 --> 57:05.204
Let's go.

57:07.598 --> 57:08.512
God damn it!

57:08.686 --> 57:10.688
Hmm.

57:10.862 --> 57:12.211
Everything all right over here?

57:12.385 --> 57:13.691
Mmm?

57:13.865 --> 57:15.040
Y'all working
my nerve today.

57:16.911 --> 57:18.130
What is all this?

57:22.917 --> 57:25.137
Just... You two, wait for me.

57:27.531 --> 57:30.664
Read instruction
0.01 for me, please.

57:34.712 --> 57:36.191
Uh...

57:36.365 --> 57:37.671
"To maintain the integrity
of the jury system,

57:37.845 --> 57:39.630
I remind you that you must
decide this case

57:39.804 --> 57:41.762
based only on the evidence
admitted during the trial

57:41.936 --> 57:43.895
and the law
I will explain to you.

57:44.069 --> 57:45.549
You may not conduct
any research

57:45.723 --> 57:47.464
on your own about this case

57:47.638 --> 57:50.249
or about any people or places
mentioned during the trial."

57:50.423 --> 57:51.946
Sounds to me
like you two violated

57:52.120 --> 57:53.644
every sentence
of that paragraph.

57:53.818 --> 57:55.080
Your Honor,
I move for a mistrial.

57:55.254 --> 57:56.777
He's a former cop.

57:56.951 --> 57:58.387
Who knows what ideas
he put in the jury's heads.

57:58.562 --> 58:00.302
Failure to elicit
his previous employment

58:00.477 --> 58:03.262
during voir dire
is on you, Mr. Resnick.

58:03.436 --> 58:05.003
It's misconduct.

58:05.177 --> 58:06.744
Kick him off, Judge.
There's no need to start over.

58:06.918 --> 58:09.224
Our resources are already
stretched so thin.

58:12.314 --> 58:14.099
She's right. Motion denied.

58:14.273 --> 58:15.622
Your Honor. You know...

58:16.449 --> 58:17.711
As for you two...

58:20.453 --> 58:22.150
You violated
your oath as jurors.

58:24.849 --> 58:26.285
Your Honor...

58:26.459 --> 58:27.852
if I may. I, uh...

58:28.026 --> 58:30.419
I upheld the oath I took
as a police officer

58:30.594 --> 58:32.509
to never betray my character,

58:32.683 --> 58:35.033
my integrity,
or the public trust.

58:40.604 --> 58:42.736
Mr. Chicowski,

58:42.910 --> 58:44.956
you are hereby removed
from Jury Service.

58:46.914 --> 58:47.872
On account of your background,

58:48.046 --> 58:49.351
I'm going to make an exception

58:49.526 --> 58:52.093
and not find you
in contempt of court.

58:53.442 --> 58:54.705
Thank you, Your Honor.

58:56.228 --> 58:57.882
So Mr. Kemp,

58:58.056 --> 59:00.058
you are not a retired
law enforcement officer,
are you?

59:00.232 --> 59:01.886
No. No, Your Honor.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.409
So how do you explain

59:03.583 --> 59:07.326
your involvement
in this transgression?

59:07.500 --> 59:10.024
I obtained those documents
on my own, Your Honor.

59:10.198 --> 59:12.070
He didn't have anything
to do with it.

59:13.245 --> 59:14.376
Is that true?

59:14.551 --> 59:15.856
Mmm.

59:16.030 --> 59:17.554
I mean, did you look
at these documents

59:17.728 --> 59:19.338
or help to procure them

59:19.512 --> 59:21.906
or know what Mr. Chicowski
was intending to do?

59:22.080 --> 59:24.343
No, Your Honor.
I did not look at them

59:24.517 --> 59:25.649
and I didn't help.

59:27.868 --> 59:29.914
So do you think
that you can disregard

59:30.088 --> 59:31.916
everything that
you heard just now

59:32.090 --> 59:34.396
and remain an unbiased
member of this panel?

59:34.571 --> 59:35.833
Yes, I can.

59:37.617 --> 59:39.880
I'm going to take you
at your word.

59:40.054 --> 59:43.536
Bailiff, please escort Mr. Kemp
back to the juror room.

59:45.190 --> 59:49.107
Mr. Chicowski,
you are dismissed.

59:49.281 --> 59:51.152
Your Honor, I would ask
that a copy of these documents

59:51.326 --> 59:52.676
be made part
of the court's records

59:52.850 --> 59:54.025
for purposes of appeal.

59:54.199 --> 59:56.331
And again,
I move for a mistrial.

59:56.505 --> 59:59.596
The documents will be marked
as court's Exhibit One.

59:59.770 --> 01:00:03.817
Your motion for a mistrial
is denied, Mr. Resnick.

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:06.428
Is that understood?

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:09.214
Yes, Your Honor.
It's understood.

01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:11.869
Good. Then we are done here.

01:00:20.355 --> 01:00:22.140
- You got to be kidding me.
- What?

01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:24.316
"Our resources
are stretched so thin"?

01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:26.448
You are something.

01:00:30.278 --> 01:00:31.279
Okay.

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:39.853
Counselor.

01:00:40.027 --> 01:00:41.028
Hey, it's okay.
I'm not on the jury anymore.

01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:42.290
- You don't have to...
- Yeah.

01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:43.901
Yeah, made sure of that.

01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:48.122
Feeling the pressure, huh?

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.430
In this job? Nah.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:54.607
Yeah. Okay.

01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:03.660
Hey, I'm...
Sorry, but I just...

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:05.792
I can't not say this. You...

01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:09.840
You got this case
all wrong.

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:12.756
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.061
It's a hit-and-run.

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:16.411
No way.
ME would have flagged it.

01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:18.805
Well, yeah, you'd think.

01:01:18.979 --> 01:01:21.155
That guy did
five autopsies that day.

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:23.418
One day. I checked.

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:24.898
Doesn't mean anything.

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:32.079
Let me just ask you one thing.

01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:34.429
Did you guys ever look
at any other suspect?

01:01:36.431 --> 01:01:38.651
We did our job.

01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:40.740
All due respect, Counselor,
if you'd have done your job,

01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:42.394
I don't think we'd be
standing here right now.

01:01:42.568 --> 01:01:44.439
Well, that guy is bad news.

01:01:46.877 --> 01:01:47.834
Maybe.

01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:51.708
But he didn't kill that girl.

01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:09.987
All right.
So with that being said,

01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:12.293
Judge Stewart thanks you
for your patience

01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:14.992
and apologizes
for any inconvenience.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:18.430
Juror number 13 is now
a voting member of this panel.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:20.214
Okay.

01:02:20.388 --> 01:02:22.129
I'll let you guys
get back to it.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:27.569
So what happened?

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.876
What was this misconduct?

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:31.748
Uh, that's between
him and the judge.

01:02:31.922 --> 01:02:34.054
Bullshit. You were there.

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.534
What did Harold do?

01:02:37.144 --> 01:02:40.191
He was investigating
the case on his own.

01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:41.366
The judge sent him home.

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.282
What about
that stack of papers?

01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:45.413
What papers?

01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:47.241
The ones Harold gave to him.

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:49.113
You dropped them
all over the floor.
We all saw it.

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:52.333
The bailiff was on us before
I looked at the papers, so...

01:02:52.507 --> 01:02:54.422
You were talking
for quite a while.

01:02:54.596 --> 01:02:56.424
Did he tell you
what was in them?

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.254
Okay, yes, he did. It...

01:03:00.428 --> 01:03:03.388
It was a printout.
Names, vehicle registrations...

01:03:03.562 --> 01:03:06.130
He said that it could prove

01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:07.261
James Sythe's innocence.

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:09.394
So what?

01:03:09.568 --> 01:03:10.699
Are we just supposed
to believe you now

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.049
and change our vote?

01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.311
No, I'm just telling you
what I know.

01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:17.054
He thinks it was a hit-and-run.

01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:52.785
So if he thinks
it was a hit-and-run...

01:03:57.268 --> 01:03:58.922
Kendall was 5'5".

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:03.013
If she was hunched over,

01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:06.277
and the car was
an SUV or a truck,

01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:07.974
she could have easily
have been hit

01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:09.889
smack across
the head and torso.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.894
Look at the way
her shoulders are fractured.

01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:17.114
Well, I'm sorry,
but are you a doctor?

01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:21.161
Not yet.
Third-year med student.

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:22.859
I... I mean,

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:24.643
I think we should leave
that to the professionals,

01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:26.558
the medical examiner who,
you know, examined the body.

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:29.387
Well, I mean,
doctors can be careless.

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:31.606
One time they told my dad
he was having a heart attack.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.652
Turned out it was just gas.

01:04:33.826 --> 01:04:36.307
They're always
in such a rush.

01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:38.309
Go ahead, dear.
Speak your mind.

01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:46.099
The right and left clavicle
both show a very clean break.

01:04:46.273 --> 01:04:47.579
Can you pass this around?

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:50.799
She couldn't get that
from the fall?

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.454
It's not likely.

01:04:53.628 --> 01:04:58.242
Both bones had to be broken
by a single,

01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:00.897
sharp, posterior impact.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:04.335
Pow.

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:07.425
Do we know if Sythe's car
had any damage?

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:10.384
No. The police
would have noted it

01:05:10.558 --> 01:05:11.864
in their report if it did.

01:05:12.038 --> 01:05:13.300
Not if they thought
it was irrelevant.

01:05:13.474 --> 01:05:15.476
Cops hate paperwork.

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.304
So you're some kind
of secret cop now, too?

01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:19.785
No. I'm a dog groomer,

01:05:19.959 --> 01:05:22.614
but I watch and listen
to a lot of true crime,

01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:24.659
and the first rule
is the husband did it.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.140
Okay, well,

01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:29.099
husband, boyfriend.
Same difference.

01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:30.752
You agree
that he's guilty, right?

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.015
He is the perfect suspect.

01:05:32.189 --> 01:05:33.407
All right. Thank you.

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:34.887
But the second rule
of true crime

01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:37.237
is that it's never
the perfect suspect.

01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:39.413
Oh, my God.

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.286
I'm just sharing with you
my experiences.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.419
Your experiences?
Listening to crime podcasts.

01:05:45.593 --> 01:05:47.421
Well, hold on.
And watching <i>Dateline.</i>

01:05:47.595 --> 01:05:49.989
Okay. Well, that doesn't
make you Sherlock Holmes.

01:05:50.163 --> 01:05:51.512
Oh, thank you.

01:05:51.686 --> 01:05:53.558
No, you burn
through enough cases,

01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:56.300
and you start to see
certain patterns.

01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:58.345
But I leave the detective work
to the forum lawyers.

01:05:58.519 --> 01:05:59.956
Okay, good. Good.

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.609
Because we're not here
to solve a mystery, okay?

01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:03.742
All we're here to do
is decide if we're positive

01:06:03.916 --> 01:06:06.658
James Sythe killed
Kendall Carter. That's it.

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:07.702
-  May I?
- Oh.

01:06:07.876 --> 01:06:08.877
I'm not.

01:06:10.879 --> 01:06:13.621
Old Quarry Road
feeds into the highway.

01:06:13.795 --> 01:06:16.494
When traffic's heavy,
GPS will send you that way.

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:18.017
It gets busy.

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:20.498
Yeah, and at night,
I mean, it's gnarly.

01:06:20.672 --> 01:06:23.109
I nearly mowed down
a deer once.

01:06:23.283 --> 01:06:24.676
What if that's what
they thought?

01:06:25.633 --> 01:06:26.765
Who thought?

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.464
Whoever hit Kendall Carter.

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:34.729
Yeah, man. I mean,
that all makes sense,

01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:37.036
but, you know, what about
our eyewitness?

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.387
Maybe he saw someone else?

01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:41.998
Okay, hold up. Wait a minute.

01:06:42.172 --> 01:06:44.217
Y'all got way too many
"maybes" for my liking.

01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:47.264
Yeah, and too many maybes
is reasonable doubt.

01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:48.482
I agree with Justin.

01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:50.832
Yeah.

01:06:52.704 --> 01:06:54.097
Okay. Keiko?

01:06:58.536 --> 01:06:59.537
Nellie?

01:07:01.452 --> 01:07:04.846
I'm not sure any more that
this young man is guilty.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.023
Right. Okay. Anyone else?

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:09.329
Not guilty.

01:07:09.895 --> 01:07:11.418
Okay.

01:07:21.689 --> 01:07:25.171
I fell asleep on Highway 17
and woke up in a ditch.

01:07:25.345 --> 01:07:26.825
Thank God the hospital
was close.

01:07:28.392 --> 01:07:30.785
Hmm. Okay.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:33.962
Thank you for your time.

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:36.356
Yep.

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.619
Yeah, we were street racing
down Greek Row.

01:07:38.793 --> 01:07:39.925
It was dumb. I know.

01:08:07.953 --> 01:08:08.954
Guilty.

01:08:10.825 --> 01:08:11.826
Guilty.

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:16.396
Not guilty.

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:19.921
Not guilty.

01:08:23.534 --> 01:08:24.491
Guilty.

01:08:26.276 --> 01:08:28.626
All right. It looks like
we're six to six.

01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:30.889
We're deadlocked.

01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:32.543
Okay, so what do we do now?

01:08:32.717 --> 01:08:35.459
Feels like the more we talk,
the less we know.

01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:37.983
I'm so tired.

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:40.899
You're so stoned, dear.

01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:42.683
Let's go back
to the beginning.

01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:44.685
Build a case piece by piece.

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:47.862
No, no. Let's stop
wasting our damn time.

01:08:48.036 --> 01:08:50.822
How about we all just
take a breath. It's...

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:52.432
It's been a long day,
but, you know, votes...

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:53.694
votes have changed, right?

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:55.261
The process is working.

01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:58.090
No, it's not.
You are wearing us down.

01:08:58.264 --> 01:09:00.962
Talking a lot,
but saying nothing.

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:03.313
I mean, hell, you go over
anything enough times,

01:09:03.487 --> 01:09:04.966
yeah, we'll start
to question it.

01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:07.360
Yeah. Like which shoes to wear.

01:09:07.534 --> 01:09:09.754
Yeah. Look...

01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:12.626
We got all these theories,
y'all, but no new evidence.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.411
Well, yeah, but those
theories are making

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:16.282
some of us question
James Sythe's guilt.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:19.024
No. No, no. You can
question it all you want,

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:21.287
but I know he's guilty.

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:24.334
Just look at his damn neck.

01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:28.033
Hey, my man. I know you
got a picture of him

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:29.165
in that book of yours.

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:34.431
I mean, yeah,
but it's not perfect, but...

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.912
Yes. See? Right there.

01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:40.045
Snake and a crown.

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:41.655
That's the West Side Crowns.

01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:44.354
They're the biggest
drug pushers in the city.

01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:45.746
How do you know that?

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.096
Because I run
the Boys and Girls Club.

01:09:48.271 --> 01:09:51.187
These guys are poisoning
their own community.

01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:55.539
This case is personal to you.

01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:57.018
Yeah, well, you're
damn right it is.

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:04.330
My little brother was 14

01:10:04.504 --> 01:10:05.766
when he got inked.

01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:11.816
A month before
his 17th birthday,
he was dead.

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:13.687
Caught a stray bullet
in some...

01:10:14.906 --> 01:10:17.474
tit-for-tat turf bullshit.

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:22.043
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.916
Yeah, that's right.
You have no idea.

01:10:28.485 --> 01:10:33.533
Look, Sythe did say
that he left that life behind.

01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:35.622
There's only one way
to leave that crew.

01:10:37.755 --> 01:10:39.104
So...

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:42.194
You can keep talking
about your theories.

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:43.935
Look, people can change.

01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:45.241
Yeah.
Keep telling yourself that.

01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:46.546
I... I do. Every day.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.592
Well, I drive a bus,

01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:50.463
and I see the same people
day in and day out,

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:51.943
and they do not change.

01:10:52.117 --> 01:10:54.424
Well, then how
am I sitting here?

01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:55.599
What are you talking about?

01:10:55.773 --> 01:10:56.730
I should be dead.

01:10:57.862 --> 01:10:58.732
I should...

01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:02.170
A little over four years ago,

01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:03.607
I wrapped my car around a tree

01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:05.696
with a blood alcohol
level that,

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.132
you know, probably
should have killed me

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:08.438
before I even got in the car

01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:11.179
and somehow...

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:12.659
walked away
with barely a scratch.

01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:14.182
Mmm. Lucky you.

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:16.010
Yeah. Yeah,
part of my sentence

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:17.708
was community service.

01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:18.970
I spent three days a week
in an elementary school

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:21.059
teaching kids how to write.

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:24.802
Uh... Alcoholics,
we can charm anybody.

01:11:24.976 --> 01:11:27.413
But the teacher
I was reporting to,

01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:28.806
I mean, she was Teflon.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.851
She saw right through me.

01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:32.636
And she...

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.378
She made me finally want to,
you know, own my shit

01:11:35.552 --> 01:11:38.250
and just take
responsibility for myself.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.558
I'm...

01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:43.081
I'm still not sure what I did

01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:44.604
to get a woman like her
to give me a chance.

01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:48.434
But her belief
and believing in myself,

01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:50.915
that I could change,
that was...

01:11:51.089 --> 01:11:53.004
That was, you know,
the first step.

01:11:54.048 --> 01:11:55.441
And...

01:11:55.615 --> 01:11:57.008
Look, the, uh...

01:11:57.182 --> 01:11:59.402
the journey never ends,
I know that...

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:00.620
But...

01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:02.883
that's...

01:12:04.102 --> 01:12:05.712
that's four years.

01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:08.759
And am I the same man
that I was four years ago? No.

01:12:09.673 --> 01:12:10.891
Absolutely not.

01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.502
Yeah, well...

01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:14.330
Now I can see...

01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:16.593
You changed.

01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:19.639
But guys like James Sythe,

01:12:20.553 --> 01:12:22.207
they don't change.

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:24.601
Okay. Think back
to his testimony.

01:12:24.775 --> 01:12:28.387
That was raw and real,
and I believed it.

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:30.520
Wait, hold on, gang.

01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:32.565
If Sythe didn't do it,
then who did?

01:12:32.739 --> 01:12:34.698
We don't have to answer that.

01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:36.482
So no one's going to pay for
what happened to that girl?

01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:38.963
- No, someone will pay.
- How do you know that?

01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.573
Because somebody
always does. Look...

01:12:40.747 --> 01:12:42.053
Look, I get how you feel,

01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:44.838
but you can't let
your feelings sway you.

01:12:45.012 --> 01:12:46.536
You don't know
anything about me, man.

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:47.754
All right.

01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:52.890
How... how old's your daughter?

01:12:53.064 --> 01:12:54.457
That's her
on the key chain, right?

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:59.026
Yeah. She, um...

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.289
She turned 16 in March.

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:02.682
How often do you
get to see her?

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.947
Not often enough.

01:13:07.121 --> 01:13:09.646
You know, during the trial,
I was sat

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.343
right in Kendall's
parents' eyeline.

01:13:11.517 --> 01:13:12.562
I could see...

01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:15.869
I mean, their pain each day.

01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:18.263
And, you know, what if
she were your daughter?

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.485
You want justice, right?
An eye for an eye.

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:24.400
Right. Yeah.

01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:26.227
But then James Sythe's family
was in court each day, too.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.794
You know, his grandma
and his niece.

01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:29.666
Uh...

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.755
What if he were
your son, right?

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.758
Wouldn't you want justice
for him, too?

01:13:37.238 --> 01:13:39.632
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose, I would.

01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:29.900
So how can I help you?

01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:31.379
Well, I just want
to have a little chat

01:14:31.554 --> 01:14:32.816
about what happened here.

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.513
Just have a little one on one.

01:14:34.687 --> 01:14:35.993
Maybe I could get
some more information

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:39.257
if something came to you
new, you know?

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:43.174
Well, like I said at the trial,
the police come by.

01:14:43.348 --> 01:14:44.828
Showed me a picture,

01:14:45.002 --> 01:14:46.482
asked me if he was the man
I saw that night.

01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:49.006
Mmm. They show you
any other pictures?

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.834
Oh, no. They knew it was him.

01:14:51.008 --> 01:14:53.576
They... They just needed me
to confirm it.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:54.881
Right.

01:14:55.926 --> 01:14:57.144
I was happy to do so.

01:14:57.318 --> 01:15:00.104
I mean, everyone
was so generous.

01:15:00.278 --> 01:15:03.107
And if I could say so,
it felt pretty good

01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:05.588
- to be needed again.
- Mmm.

01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:08.155
I'm sure it did.

01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:10.244
All right. Well,
if there's anything else
I can do for you,

01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:12.595
just give a holler.
Tea is always hot.

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:14.074
Okay.
Thank you so much.

01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:15.162
Thanks for your time, sir.

01:15:15.336 --> 01:15:16.642
Uh, James Sythe...

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:21.778
He did kill that girl, right?

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:33.398
Okay, so does anybody else
want to change their vote?

01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:37.228
Uh, well...

01:15:39.056 --> 01:15:40.057
It doesn't matter anyway.

01:15:40.231 --> 01:15:41.928
What do you mean?

01:15:42.102 --> 01:15:44.540
Because I haven't
changed my mind.

01:15:44.714 --> 01:15:45.845
All right, well,
let's just keep talking.

01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:49.109
No, no, I'm done talking.

01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:51.242
Marcus.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:54.375
So what? You're gonna
tell the judge, we...

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.552
we can't reach a verdict?

01:15:56.726 --> 01:15:58.379
It is what it is.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.207
But we're actually
making progress.

01:16:00.381 --> 01:16:03.297
-  Progress?
- Yeah.

01:16:03.471 --> 01:16:05.691
How can we continue if we
can't even reach a verdict?

01:16:05.865 --> 01:16:08.389
We've been at this for
I don't even know how long.

01:16:09.216 --> 01:16:10.478
My kids need me.

01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:13.917
I'm just trying
to do my job here.

01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:17.616
Okay? Um...

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:19.705
Courtney, what about you?
Do you want to keep going?

01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:22.403
I don't know.
Look, he yelled at her.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.189
He grabbed her arm.
He called her a bitch.

01:16:25.363 --> 01:16:27.452
He was possessive
and temperamental.

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:30.455
No, he was abusive. Screw him.

01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:33.414
Yeah. You're right.

01:16:34.241 --> 01:16:35.547
Screw him.

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:37.505
Great.
For the third time,

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.855
I get to go home
and tell my husband,

01:16:39.029 --> 01:16:39.943
"Guess what, honey?

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:42.380
I did nothing."

01:16:42.554 --> 01:16:44.556
He gets a real kick
out of that.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:46.732
I'm sorry, Denice.
I'm not changing my vote.

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:49.126
Neither am I.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.258
Yeah. Me, too.

01:16:56.046 --> 01:16:57.264
So what do we do then?

01:16:57.961 --> 01:16:58.918
Um...

01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:02.182
there's one thing we could try.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.230
Madam Foreperson.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.755
Sending a jury
to visit a crime scene

01:17:09.929 --> 01:17:11.322
once deliberations have begun

01:17:11.496 --> 01:17:13.846
is not something
I would typically allow.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.369
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

01:17:15.543 --> 01:17:18.329
this has not been
a typical deliberation.

01:17:18.503 --> 01:17:20.157
But I do think
it will be beneficial

01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.941
in helping us reach a verdict.

01:17:22.115 --> 01:17:22.986
I see.

01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:27.120
Mr. Resnick. Any objections?

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:29.470
No, Your Honor.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:30.863
Okay, Miss Killebrew?

01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:34.562
The State's fine with it.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:35.738
All right, then.

01:17:36.695 --> 01:17:39.176
Here are the rules.

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:41.700
During your visit,
you are not to speak

01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:43.659
to anyone outside
of your jury panel,

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:48.359
nor are you to speak to
each other about this case.

01:17:48.533 --> 01:17:50.404
All right, you are there
to view the locations

01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:53.538
in and around where
the crime took place.

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:58.195
And you are not to collect
evidence of any kind.

01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:00.588
Does everyone
understand these rules?

01:18:00.763 --> 01:18:02.590
- Yes, ma'am.
-  Yes, Your Honor.

01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:03.766
All right, then.

01:18:05.115 --> 01:18:06.333
This court is adjourned.

01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:10.294
Hey. Hey. Can... Can we talk?

01:18:12.339 --> 01:18:14.254
Yeah, great. Great.
I'll see you there. Thanks.

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:31.663
Hello?

01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:34.274
Oh, hey, are you
Allison Crewson?

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:36.102
Yes, I am. Yeah. Who are you?

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:37.887
I'm, um... I'm Faith Killebrew.

01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:40.541
I'm a prosecutor with
the District Attorney's office.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.805
Do you mind if we talk?

01:18:42.979 --> 01:18:44.676
I was just about to lay down,
but what is this about?

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.983
It'll only be a minute.

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.941
- Okay. Come in.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:18:55.382 --> 01:18:56.775
Uh, I'm sorry
for the intrusion.

01:18:56.949 --> 01:18:58.646
I won't be long.

01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:00.605
I'm following up on a...

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:03.086
on a few different accidents
from October last year,

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.175
just doing routine checks
on any cars

01:19:05.349 --> 01:19:07.917
that were serviced
for major body damage
around that time.

01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:09.179
Okay.

01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:11.137
So on October 25th last year,

01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:14.706
did you own a 1996
green Toyota 4Runner?

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.403
Yes.

01:19:16.577 --> 01:19:17.840
Mmm-hmm. And do you remember
having any body work

01:19:18.014 --> 01:19:20.320
- done on it around that time?
- Yeah.

01:19:20.494 --> 01:19:23.454
Okay. And how was
your car damaged?

01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:25.325
My husband, Justin, hit a deer.

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.066
Okay. Any idea where?

01:19:28.241 --> 01:19:29.765
Up on Brimstone Pass.

01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:31.679
You sure?

01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:34.726
Yeah.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.859
Could it have been
Old Quarry Road? Or...

01:19:38.512 --> 01:19:40.166
No, it was Brimstone Pass.

01:19:41.733 --> 01:19:42.734
You're positive.

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:44.954
Positive.

01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:49.523
Okay. Great.
Well, that's all I have.

01:19:51.482 --> 01:19:54.006
Thank you very much
for your time, Mrs. Crewson.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.574
And, uh, congratulations.
When are you due?

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.142
Uh...

01:19:59.316 --> 01:20:00.534
Yeah, any day now.

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:02.014
Well,
good luck with that.

01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:03.799
You want me to do anything
before I go?

01:20:03.973 --> 01:20:05.278
- No, no. No.
- Okay. Well, I'll just
see myself out.

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:06.758
- No. I'll get you...
- No, you stay there.

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:08.673
- Okay, all right.
- No, it's good.

01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:09.630
- Have a good one.
- Thank you.
Thanks for your time.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:10.327
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

01:20:32.305 --> 01:20:34.481
Hey. Sorry I couldn't
meet you earlier.

01:20:34.655 --> 01:20:36.266
- No worries.
- What's on your mind?

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.354
The trial.

01:20:37.528 --> 01:20:39.312
Well, yeah, I figured.

01:20:39.486 --> 01:20:41.010
It's headed for a hung jury.

01:20:41.184 --> 01:20:42.185
Justin!

01:20:43.142 --> 01:20:45.057
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:47.712
- I got you a coffee.
- Thanks.

01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:49.627
Obviously, I want
to acquit the guy,

01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:52.108
but if the jury hangs,
it's a mistrial, right?

01:20:52.282 --> 01:20:54.632
- That's right.
- So problem solved.

01:20:54.806 --> 01:20:56.590
Well, given all the press
on this case,

01:20:56.764 --> 01:20:58.810
the public's going
to demand a retrial.

01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:01.160
We're just gonna have to do it
all over again with Sythe.

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:03.162
Unless the District Attorney's
office decides

01:21:03.336 --> 01:21:06.731
that he's not the guy,
then they'll find the guy.

01:21:06.905 --> 01:21:09.081
And there's no way that this
case ends without a verdict.

01:21:09.255 --> 01:21:11.605
Once they get that,
then, yeah, it's over.
Then it's done.

01:21:11.779 --> 01:21:13.564
So you're saying
I need a verdict?

01:21:14.304 --> 01:21:15.435
I'm afraid so.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.802
Hey, can you meet me at County?

01:21:55.606 --> 01:21:56.433
Hey.

01:21:57.477 --> 01:21:59.827
Hey. Everything okay?

01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:04.049
Just checking the car.
Might have a buyer.

01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:11.927
Where'd you hit
that deer again?

01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:16.192
Up on Brimstone Pass, right?

01:22:17.802 --> 01:22:18.672
Mmm.

01:22:20.544 --> 01:22:22.415
Are you sure that
it wasn't Old Quarry Road?

01:22:23.677 --> 01:22:24.940
I'm positive.

01:22:25.897 --> 01:22:26.898
That's...

01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:29.727
Just that's ex...

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:32.251
"Positive," that's what
I said to the...

01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:33.992
prosecutor from your trial

01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:36.299
when she just interrogated me
in our living room.

01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:38.866
- What? She was here.
- Yeah.

01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:42.653
I looked her up.
She wanted to know about
your accident.

01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:45.221
That--

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:48.354
What'd you tell her?

01:22:48.528 --> 01:22:49.442
The truth.

01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:53.098
That you hit a deer

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:55.405
up on Brimstone Pass.

01:22:56.884 --> 01:22:58.886
Okay. Good.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.628
That is the truth, right?

01:23:04.153 --> 01:23:05.850
Did you take the shortcut...

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:07.504
home through
Old Quarry that night?

01:23:09.767 --> 01:23:11.638
Did you stop
at Rowdy's Hideaway?

01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:24.086
Did you drink?

01:23:32.746 --> 01:23:33.747
Did you?

01:23:35.749 --> 01:23:37.795
Justin. Did you drink?

01:23:39.318 --> 01:23:41.842
- Talk to me.
- No, no, I didn't drink.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.975
I didn't drink. Okay? I...

01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:48.893
I stopped and I [stammering]...

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:50.547
I ordered the drink,
but I didn't touch it.

01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:52.636
Ordered, but didn't drink.
Why would I believe that?

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:54.464
- Because that's the truth.
I promise. I swear.
- You swear?

01:23:54.638 --> 01:23:56.292
Why should I believe that?
Why should I believe anything

01:23:56.466 --> 01:23:57.641
- that you're saying anymore?
- I promise. I swear to you.

01:23:57.815 --> 01:23:58.903
- I swear to you.
- You swear to me?

01:23:59.077 --> 01:23:59.904
- I swear.
- Don't lie to me.

01:24:00.078 --> 01:24:01.036
I'm not lying. I promise.

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:02.950
I promise. That is the truth.

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:03.951
Okay?

01:24:05.301 --> 01:24:06.302
Look, it...

01:24:08.217 --> 01:24:09.174
It...

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.439
It was the twins' due date
and I couldn't deal

01:24:13.613 --> 01:24:14.614
with the feelings
that I was having.

01:24:14.788 --> 01:24:16.486
I couldn't deal with them,

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.183
so I didn't want to bring them
home and put them on you.

01:24:18.966 --> 01:24:20.229
So I went there.

01:24:20.403 --> 01:24:21.926
I sat there for a while,
and then I...

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.884
and then I came home.

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.061
Why didn't
you tell me any of this?

01:24:26.235 --> 01:24:27.888
Why did you keep this from me?

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:29.064
- I wanted... I wanted to.
- You could've talked to me.

01:24:29.238 --> 01:24:30.326
But you were in so much pain.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.719
Of course I was in pain.

01:24:32.893 --> 01:24:34.460
I kept thinking that I was
somehow responsible,

01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:35.983
that it was my fault,
that it's still my...

01:24:36.158 --> 01:24:37.507
No. No. It was not your fault.

01:24:37.681 --> 01:24:38.986
- They were my babies.
- It's not... It's not...

01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:40.727
- They were our babies.
- I know.

01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:43.774
None... None... None of this
is your fault, okay?

01:24:43.948 --> 01:24:45.993
We were both hurting.
It still hurts.

01:24:48.518 --> 01:24:49.606
I'm still hurting.

01:24:53.697 --> 01:24:54.611
Me, too.

01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:57.831
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:04.011 --> 01:25:06.188
I'm not doing this alone.

01:25:06.362 --> 01:25:08.233
No, you're not. You're not.

01:25:08.407 --> 01:25:09.582
You are not.

01:25:09.756 --> 01:25:12.629
I will protect our family.
I will.

01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:16.241
I promise. Okay?

01:25:19.549 --> 01:25:21.420
Hey, come here. Come here.

01:25:37.567 --> 01:25:38.829
What the hell is going on?

01:25:39.003 --> 01:25:40.874
- Ugh, I need to see him.
- Why?

01:25:41.048 --> 01:25:42.180
I need him
to look me in the eye

01:25:42.354 --> 01:25:43.486
and tell me he didn't do it.

01:25:45.444 --> 01:25:46.489
So you're having doubts?

01:25:46.663 --> 01:25:47.664
I'm right. You're doubting it?

01:25:47.838 --> 01:25:49.666
I... I don't know.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.320
What do you mean
you don't know?

01:25:51.494 --> 01:25:52.669
Come on. You know
something isn't right here.

01:25:52.843 --> 01:25:54.758
The jury knows it. It's just...

01:25:54.932 --> 01:25:56.629
Can you prove
that's what happened?

01:25:56.803 --> 01:25:58.979
Can you prove it didn't?
Can you?

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.068
I don't know.
Just get me in there.

01:26:16.867 --> 01:26:17.911
What are you doing here?

01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:20.653
Have a seat.

01:26:22.394 --> 01:26:23.526
I shouldn't be talking to you.

01:26:24.614 --> 01:26:25.528
It's okay.

01:26:31.925 --> 01:26:33.057
What do you want?

01:26:34.363 --> 01:26:36.278
Same thing as you.

01:26:36.452 --> 01:26:37.888
Justice for Kendall Carter.

01:26:38.062 --> 01:26:39.933
So go find the son of a bitch
who did it.

01:26:42.632 --> 01:26:44.286
Look, there's no jury,

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.940
no judge, no cameras.
So just...

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:48.333
tell me what happened
that night.

01:26:48.507 --> 01:26:50.466
I told you. I went home.

01:26:52.685 --> 01:26:54.644
Right, but first, you...

01:26:54.818 --> 01:26:56.820
you followed her, right?

01:26:58.038 --> 01:26:59.344
Yeah. I mean, she was wasted.

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.739
Oh, no. So you felt angry

01:27:02.913 --> 01:27:04.915
and, I don't know,
sick of being played?

01:27:05.089 --> 01:27:07.352
No, no, that wasn't it. Okay?

01:27:08.745 --> 01:27:10.529
It's just how Kenny was.

01:27:10.703 --> 01:27:12.705
She'd get all worked up,
you know, talk this big game,

01:27:12.879 --> 01:27:15.404
and the next day,
it'd be like nothing happened.

01:27:15.578 --> 01:27:17.144
So she just needed
to chill out.

01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:19.234
Right.

01:27:20.626 --> 01:27:21.627
Yes, okay, I...

01:27:23.194 --> 01:27:26.241
I know our relationship
wasn't perfect.

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:29.679
But we did love each other.

01:27:32.769 --> 01:27:34.466
Now, listen, lady...

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.034
I've done a lot of things
in my life

01:27:37.208 --> 01:27:38.340
that I'm not proud of.

01:27:40.385 --> 01:27:42.779
But I didn't do this.

01:27:47.174 --> 01:27:48.263
The biggest regret...

01:27:50.003 --> 01:27:51.135
of my life...

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.356
is that I didn't
go after Kendall

01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:55.748
in my car that night.

01:27:57.707 --> 01:27:58.708
Because if I did...

01:28:00.666 --> 01:28:02.059
Kenny would still be alive.

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:06.281
I'm done.

01:28:22.253 --> 01:28:23.994
All right, everybody,
on the bus. Let's go.

01:29:01.248 --> 01:29:03.555
Ah. Look, but don't touch.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.601
Put it back.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.706
<i>Okay, y'all.
You ready to go?</i>

01:30:40.173 --> 01:30:42.219
So this is where they fought.

01:31:46.675 --> 01:31:48.024
Hey, you all right?

01:31:49.373 --> 01:31:50.766
Yeah. I'm fine, thanks.

01:31:51.418 --> 01:31:52.419
Nah, man.

01:31:54.204 --> 01:31:55.858
You haven't been fine
since the start.

01:31:58.338 --> 01:32:00.340
I think you've been playing us
this whole time.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:02.734
I don't know what you mean.

01:32:05.258 --> 01:32:06.869
The day you got
on the jury, you were...

01:32:08.305 --> 01:32:11.047
puking in the bathroom.

01:32:11.221 --> 01:32:13.745
All that stuff
with the Flower Man cop
and those papers.

01:32:15.965 --> 01:32:17.053
You claim to be
the voice of reason,

01:32:17.227 --> 01:32:18.794
but you're really just...

01:32:18.968 --> 01:32:20.230
telling us
what we want to hear.

01:32:29.282 --> 01:32:30.632
Now, I don't know
what game you're playing, man,

01:32:30.806 --> 01:32:31.850
but I see you.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:37.943
Do I know exactly
what happened that night?

01:32:38.117 --> 01:32:39.510
No.

01:32:39.684 --> 01:32:41.643
But neither do you.

01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:45.516
And you can't be any more sure

01:32:45.690 --> 01:32:47.997
that James Sythe got in his car

01:32:48.171 --> 01:32:51.043
and drove home that night
than I'm sure he...

01:32:52.915 --> 01:32:54.656
picked up one of these rocks

01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:56.571
and bashed
that poor girl's head in.

01:32:58.311 --> 01:32:59.748
And threw her body
in the creek.

01:33:06.276 --> 01:33:08.321
Jesus, man.

01:33:08.495 --> 01:33:10.585
- You nearly slipped.
- Yeah.

01:33:15.807 --> 01:33:18.244
Maybe that hiker was right.

01:33:18.418 --> 01:33:20.638
- Could have slipped.
- Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

01:33:22.031 --> 01:33:23.162
But it doesn't matter.

01:33:26.818 --> 01:33:29.516
That piece of shit
left her there that night...

01:33:30.474 --> 01:33:32.563
alone, to die.

01:33:32.737 --> 01:33:33.912
In a ditch.

01:33:36.262 --> 01:33:37.916
Her death is on him.

01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:40.658
Which is why I will never
acquit James Sythe.

01:33:42.007 --> 01:33:42.965
Ever.

01:33:47.273 --> 01:33:48.753
This trial ends
in only two ways,

01:33:48.927 --> 01:33:51.626
either with a conviction
or a hung jury.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.975
All right.

01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:54.585
Is everybody ready
to head home?

01:33:57.066 --> 01:33:58.633
Is everybody done here, please?

01:34:00.504 --> 01:34:01.461
Yeah.

01:34:06.292 --> 01:34:07.206
Okay, let's go.

01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:11.733
Have you seen enough?

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:13.560
Yeah.

01:35:19.322 --> 01:35:20.323
All rise!

01:35:40.865 --> 01:35:42.084
Madam Foreperson.

01:35:45.522 --> 01:35:47.045
Has the jury reached a verdict?

01:35:47.916 --> 01:35:49.613
Yes, Your Honor.

01:35:49.787 --> 01:35:51.789
And is that verdict unanimous?

01:35:52.616 --> 01:35:53.748
Yes, Your Honor.

01:36:21.123 --> 01:36:23.821
Will the defendant please stand
for the reading of the verdict?

01:36:30.523 --> 01:36:34.658
"In the matter
of the <i>State of Georgia
vs. James Michael Sythe,</i>

01:36:34.832 --> 01:36:39.750
case number C-R-20211715532,

01:36:41.012 --> 01:36:42.579
we, the jury

01:36:42.753 --> 01:36:45.321
find the defendant,
James Michael Sythe

01:36:45.495 --> 01:36:48.019
guilty of count one
malice murder.

01:36:49.281 --> 01:36:51.283
Signed and dated this day,

01:36:51.457 --> 01:36:54.156
Denice Aldworth, Foreperson."

01:36:55.766 --> 01:36:56.854
Madam Foreperson?

01:36:57.942 --> 01:36:59.291
To the best of your knowledge,

01:36:59.465 --> 01:37:01.728
was this your verdict
in the jury room?

01:37:01.903 --> 01:37:04.296
Was it freely
and voluntarily given?

01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:05.820
And is this still your verdict?

01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:08.648
Yes, Your Honor.

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:10.041
Very well.

01:37:10.215 --> 01:37:12.000
Then the defendant
is hereby remanded

01:37:12.174 --> 01:37:14.741
to the custody of the State.

01:37:14.916 --> 01:37:17.005
Sentencing will be
at a later date.

01:37:21.357 --> 01:37:23.359
Oh, James.

01:37:27.667 --> 01:37:29.669
Thank you for your service.

01:37:29.844 --> 01:37:30.975
It is now concluded.

01:37:32.542 --> 01:37:33.804
This court is adjourned.

01:39:02.327 --> 01:39:04.460
Hey. Good. Right there.

01:39:06.244 --> 01:39:07.942
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:39:08.116 --> 01:39:09.421
- What time does it start?
- Soon. I'm going to head out.

01:39:09.595 --> 01:39:10.727
You sure you want to go?

01:39:11.423 --> 01:39:12.511
Hey! Justin.

01:39:12.685 --> 01:39:14.513
He wasn't a good guy.

01:39:14.687 --> 01:39:15.950
It's not your fault.

01:39:18.256 --> 01:39:19.431
I didn't stand up for him.

01:39:21.303 --> 01:39:23.000
I told them what they
needed to hear,

01:39:23.174 --> 01:39:24.393
and said he couldn't change.

01:39:25.916 --> 01:39:27.700
And I have
to live with that, so...

01:39:31.574 --> 01:39:32.488
The least I can do is be there.

01:39:38.276 --> 01:39:39.495
Hi, peanut.

01:39:54.379 --> 01:39:55.250
This came for you.

01:40:28.631 --> 01:40:31.416
Will the defendant
please stand for sentencing?

01:40:35.377 --> 01:40:40.947
The murder of Kendall Carter
was violent and senseless.

01:40:41.122 --> 01:40:43.689
The jury has found you
guilty of that murder,

01:40:43.863 --> 01:40:46.910
for which this court
sentences you as follows.

01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:50.174
Count one, malice murder.

01:40:51.958 --> 01:40:53.177
Life in prison

01:40:53.351 --> 01:40:55.179
without the possibility
of parole.

01:40:57.138 --> 01:40:59.096
The defendant
is hereby remanded

01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:00.967
to the Department
of Corrections

01:41:01.142 --> 01:41:03.187
to serve the rest
of his life in prison.

01:41:28.343 --> 01:41:29.822
<i>My husband,
Justin, hit a deer.</i>

01:41:29.996 --> 01:41:31.389
<i>My wife is of
a high-risk pregnancy.</i>

01:41:45.577 --> 01:41:47.275
This court
is now adjourned.

01:42:08.687 --> 01:42:09.688
Hey.

01:42:11.429 --> 01:42:12.952
I'm surprised you came today.

01:42:16.217 --> 01:42:17.653
I wanted to see this through.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.568
Yeah. Me too.

01:42:24.921 --> 01:42:26.009
You look tired.

01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:29.491
Likewise.

01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:32.276
Well, I have
a new baby at home.

01:42:33.582 --> 01:42:34.670
That's not what I meant.

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.548
Congratulations on winning
your election.

01:42:43.722 --> 01:42:45.637
- I saw it in the paper.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

01:42:45.811 --> 01:42:47.465
It's a pretty big deal.
You must have
worked hard for it.

01:42:47.639 --> 01:42:48.597
Oh, I did.

01:42:51.034 --> 01:42:53.167
There's a lot of good
you can do in that job,
I'd imagine.

01:42:54.385 --> 01:42:55.430
Sometimes.

01:42:57.475 --> 01:42:59.042
It's not as easy
as you think, though.

01:43:00.783 --> 01:43:02.219
Never is.

01:43:02.393 --> 01:43:04.526
Mmm. Sometimes you try
and do the right thing

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.267
only to realize
you got it all wrong.

01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:14.231
And when you figure things out,

01:43:14.405 --> 01:43:16.364
you realize the guy
you're after isn't some...

01:43:17.408 --> 01:43:19.062
psycho.

01:43:19.236 --> 01:43:20.716
He's not even
really a criminal.

01:43:22.674 --> 01:43:24.285
He's just a regular guy.

01:43:28.376 --> 01:43:29.725
What if it was an accident?

01:43:29.899 --> 01:43:30.987
This is no accident.

01:43:34.599 --> 01:43:36.775
It's impossible to prove,
either way.

01:43:36.949 --> 01:43:38.995
Just like him
not realizing at the time

01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:40.866
that he hit someone
with his car. It's...

01:43:44.609 --> 01:43:45.828
You just have to trust him.

01:43:47.873 --> 01:43:48.961
Why would I do that?

01:43:50.267 --> 01:43:52.530
Because he's a good person.

01:43:52.704 --> 01:43:54.967
He was caught
in terrible circumstances.

01:43:55.141 --> 01:43:57.492
Mmm-hmm. No, you're right.
This is a...

01:43:57.666 --> 01:43:58.971
It's a tough one.

01:44:01.626 --> 01:44:03.062
He has a family
depending on him,

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:04.934
just like you have people
depending on you.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.545
And what about justice?

01:44:13.943 --> 01:44:15.553
Well, sometimes...

01:44:15.727 --> 01:44:17.947
the truth isn't justice.

01:44:18.121 --> 01:44:20.471
You really
believe that?

01:44:26.129 --> 01:44:28.349
If you keep going with this,

01:44:28.523 --> 01:44:30.655
the press will eat you alive.

01:44:30.829 --> 01:44:32.701
Okay? This case
will follow you forever.

01:44:32.875 --> 01:44:34.137
In the meantime,

01:44:34.311 --> 01:44:36.400
some politician
will take your job,

01:44:36.574 --> 01:44:38.489
a criminal goes back
on the street,

01:44:38.663 --> 01:44:40.796
and a good man
and his family will be...

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:43.625
just destroyed.

01:44:46.802 --> 01:44:48.978
Where is the justice in that?

01:45:22.881 --> 01:45:23.882
Amen.

01:45:42.031 --> 01:45:43.467
Looks like the storm passed.

01:45:44.425 --> 01:45:46.252
Yeah. I think so.

01:46:10.494 --> 01:46:12.540
Hello?
Where's our new DA?

01:46:14.063 --> 01:46:16.108
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:46:16.282 --> 01:46:18.110
- For the new digs.
- Oh.

01:46:18.284 --> 01:46:20.374
- Thanks.
- Yeah. It's real.

01:46:20.548 --> 01:46:22.376
Easy plant to take care of.

01:46:24.029 --> 01:46:26.728
It really thrives on neglect.

01:46:26.902 --> 01:46:28.947
You did it.

01:46:30.688 --> 01:46:32.037
I hope it was worth it.

01:46:38.043 --> 01:46:39.610
Ale House later.

01:46:39.784 --> 01:46:40.698
You're buying.

01:47:03.808 --> 01:47:05.941
Kung fu!

01:47:06.115 --> 01:47:09.074
- Hi.
- And the 4Runner
is officially sold.

01:47:09.248 --> 01:47:10.075
Okay.

01:47:13.688 --> 01:47:14.602
Come here.

01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:22.087
- Hi.
- Oh.

01:47:23.785 --> 01:47:25.177
Good morning. Dada.

01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:26.614
Yeah.

01:47:26.788 --> 01:47:28.616
- There she goes.
- Come here. Here we go.

01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:31.706
Yeah. Yeah.
You're doing good. Hi.

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:34.752
It sucks.
I think she has my eyes.

01:47:34.926 --> 01:47:36.058
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:47:36.232 --> 01:47:38.060
- No.
- Yeah.

01:47:38.234 --> 01:47:39.670
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Well...

01:47:40.758 --> 01:47:42.194
Look, I think, maybe mine.

01:47:42.368 --> 01:47:43.500
They're changing a little bit.

01:47:43.674 --> 01:47:46.285
Yeah, hi.

01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:48.157
- She has my mouth.
- I hope not.

01:47:51.508 --> 01:47:52.683
Definitely your elbows, though.

01:47:52.857 --> 01:47:53.989
My elb--

01:47:54.163 --> 01:47:55.773
My elbow.

01:47:55.947 --> 01:47:57.949
Look at your beautiful elbows.
You're blessed.

01:47:58.123 --> 01:48:00.038
My greatest feature.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.478
Hi.

01:48:06.654 --> 01:48:07.829
My girls.

01:48:08.003 --> 01:48:10.396
My girls
with beautiful elbows. Yeah.

01:48:10.571 --> 01:48:12.442
Oh.

01:48:13.008 --> 01:48:14.357
Oh.

01:48:14.531 --> 01:48:16.228
Who could that be
at a time like this?

01:48:16.402 --> 01:48:17.534
- Hey, peanut.
- There we go.

01:48:17.708 --> 01:48:18.883
Hi, honey.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.885
Okay.
