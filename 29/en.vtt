Get back inside.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.052
Dr. Timmis.
<i>- Well, hello, Dr. Timmis.</i>

04:20.156 --> 04:21.951
It's Mrs. Timmis here.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.711
<i>I thought you were staying
at the house tonight.</i>

04:23.815 --> 04:25.920
I am. That's where
I'm calling you from.

04:26.024 --> 04:29.199
I found a signal.
<i>- Where?</i>

04:29.303 --> 04:31.788
Upstairs at the, uh,
end of the walkway.

04:31.892 --> 04:32.996
<i>Are you still staying
out there tonight?</i>

04:33.100 --> 04:35.033
Yeah.

04:35.136 --> 04:36.621
<i>I'm going to drive into the
village in a little while</i>

04:36.724 --> 04:38.450
<i>for some dinner,
and then I'm just going to</i>

04:38.554 --> 04:40.245
<i>keep at it until
I get tired, really.</i>

04:40.349 --> 04:41.971
Okay.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.249
<i>Well, don't work too late.</i>

04:44.353 --> 04:46.458
Oh, um, maybe we can
invite my sister

04:46.562 --> 04:48.702
for dinner tomorrow evening?

04:48.805 --> 04:51.291
I'm kind of worried about her.

04:51.394 --> 04:54.604
<i>Uh, Darcy can take
care of herself.</i>

04:54.708 --> 04:56.192
She's meant to have
regular check-ups

04:56.296 --> 04:58.712
and she just gets mad
when I ask her.

04:58.815 --> 05:01.162
Well, do you want me to ask?

05:01.266 --> 05:03.579
I am a doctor.
<i>- Would you?</i>

05:03.682 --> 05:06.375
Yeah, of course.
I can be the villain.

05:06.478 --> 05:08.342
Well, you're my hero.

05:08.446 --> 05:11.518
<i>I'd better get
back to it here.</i>

05:11.621 --> 05:13.278
<i>I'll see you in the morning.</i>

05:13.382 --> 05:15.349
Okay. I love you.

05:15.453 --> 05:17.558
Love you.

05:27.257 --> 05:28.569
Come on.

05:30.744 --> 05:32.711
Let's stretch our legs,
shall we?

05:52.006 --> 05:54.388
<i>Hello.
You've reached Darcy Odello.</i>

05:54.492 --> 05:56.563
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

05:56.666 --> 05:59.807
Hey, guess what.

05:59.911 --> 06:03.570
We are connected.

08:24.814 --> 08:27.368
Could you open the door?

08:27.472 --> 08:29.509
What do you want?

08:33.858 --> 08:35.135
You're in trouble.

08:37.275 --> 08:38.759
I saw you come out of the house
just now.

08:38.863 --> 08:40.002
You went to the car
to get something.

08:40.105 --> 08:43.764
You left this door
open behind you.

08:43.868 --> 08:45.317
Somebody went inside.

08:45.421 --> 08:47.734
What?

08:47.837 --> 08:50.046
I saw you go to your car,
and you left the door open.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.877
Somebody slipped inside.
They're in there now.

08:56.950 --> 09:00.091
- Well, I didn't see anyone.
- I know that.

09:00.194 --> 09:02.093
Your back was turned.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.994
What are you doing
standing outside my house?

09:07.098 --> 09:08.893
My husband's going
to be back any minute.

09:11.205 --> 09:13.587
Dr. Timmis works nights.

09:15.382 --> 09:17.039
Oh, um...

09:21.491 --> 09:24.115
Are you a-a patient
of-- of Ted's?

09:24.218 --> 09:28.119
I heard them in the wall

09:28.222 --> 09:30.915
and I came here
and I saw someone.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.953
Would you just open the door?

09:35.057 --> 09:37.749
- Okay.
- I'm trying to help you.

09:42.236 --> 09:44.791
Is there someone here?

09:44.894 --> 09:48.139
They're not gonna answer you.

09:48.242 --> 09:50.382
Is there someone in here?

09:52.522 --> 09:54.870
There's nobody in here
except me,

09:54.973 --> 09:56.457
and-- and
you've made a mistake.

09:56.561 --> 10:02.291
And I'd, uh-- I'd really
like you to leave now, please.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.396
If you don't,
I'm going to call the police.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.917
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, call them.

10:11.093 --> 10:13.233
Call them!

10:13.336 --> 10:17.202
Well, I-I can't find my phone.
It was in my car.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.690
Do you have a phone?
- No.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.255
Do you-- do you
really think you saw someone?

10:35.358 --> 10:38.638
I am telling you that there
is someone in there with you.

10:39.984 --> 10:44.436
If I open the door,
what are you going to do?

10:46.853 --> 10:50.373
I'll-- I'll-- I'll
look around.

10:50.477 --> 10:52.893
And if you don't see anyone?

10:55.827 --> 10:58.036
I'll leave.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.894
Yeah. Good.

15:15.017 --> 15:18.296
Curses are lifted

15:18.400 --> 15:20.712
Cursed.

15:20.816 --> 15:22.956
That's right.

15:23.060 --> 15:26.270
Does that really deter anyone
from shoplifting?

15:26.373 --> 15:28.203
Apart from the superstitious.

15:31.516 --> 15:34.761
You'd be surprised how many
stolen items are returned to me.

15:34.864 --> 15:37.108
For those lucky enough
to figure out

15:37.212 --> 15:41.388
where their sudden bad luck
is coming from.

15:41.492 --> 15:44.184
Your mother would have
been proud of you, Darcy.

15:44.288 --> 15:46.290
Ted.

15:53.607 --> 15:54.954
Oh.

16:01.270 --> 16:03.203
It's been a while, Ted.

16:03.307 --> 16:05.412
I know. I'm sorry.

16:05.516 --> 16:08.726
I've been trying to settle
back into things.

16:11.142 --> 16:14.318
How's business?

16:14.421 --> 16:16.458
It's good.

16:16.561 --> 16:18.943
What were you doing there?
You seemed very focused on that.

16:19.047 --> 16:24.431
Oh. This is, uh...

16:24.535 --> 16:27.089
one of the more
interesting items that has been

16:27.193 --> 16:29.057
brought to the store
in quite a while.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.681
Oh, yeah? Interesting how?

16:32.784 --> 16:33.785
Well, it's haunted.

16:38.928 --> 16:42.001
Really? What do you mean?

16:42.104 --> 16:43.726
There was a man,

16:43.830 --> 16:48.938
not a very pleasant one,
who spent most of his life

16:49.042 --> 16:52.183
working as a bellboy in a hotel.

16:52.287 --> 16:58.914
And one night, he was showing
a drunk guest to his room,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.227
and the guest
shoved him down the stairs

17:01.330 --> 17:04.609
and-- and he broke his neck
and he died in the fall.

17:04.713 --> 17:07.336
And a few days later,
the receptionist rang the bell

17:07.440 --> 17:09.959
to summon the new bellboy.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.272
Only, who did she see
running towards her

17:12.376 --> 17:13.791
not looking very happy?

17:18.761 --> 17:22.524
Are you telling me that
if you ring that bell,

17:22.627 --> 17:24.629
a dead bellboy
will come running?

17:29.151 --> 17:31.843
Well, ring it.
Let's see what happens.

17:34.639 --> 17:37.366
It's not something
to be played with, Ted.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.576
Seeing as the last two people
who rang this bell

17:40.680 --> 17:41.715
were found dead.

17:43.165 --> 17:45.098
Okay.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.346
Dani used to say
that one of her goals

17:51.449 --> 17:55.004
was to open
that closed mind of yours.

17:55.108 --> 17:59.457
She tried. I'm a doctor.
Science and logic.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.252
Okay.

18:05.567 --> 18:09.018
I have something
for you, Darcy.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.607
Declan Barrett died last week.

18:11.711 --> 18:13.057
Heart attack.

18:13.161 --> 18:15.197
How do I know that name?

18:15.301 --> 18:17.303
He was in the halfway house
with Olin Boole

18:17.406 --> 18:18.890
the night he was killed.

18:18.994 --> 18:22.170
They found it...

18:22.273 --> 18:24.689
clearing out his belongings.

18:32.007 --> 18:33.974
You found it.

18:34.078 --> 18:37.806
It's here.
I have it here in my hand.

18:46.228 --> 18:51.026
That's it. That's all
that's left of him.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.235
My impulse was to crush it
under my shoe,

18:53.339 --> 18:55.824
but then I remembered
you wanted it.

18:57.274 --> 18:59.276
He should never have
been discharged.

18:59.379 --> 19:03.901
He was dangerous.
I should have seen it.

19:04.004 --> 19:07.215
It wasn't your fault, Ted.

19:07.318 --> 19:10.218
Why do you want it?

19:10.321 --> 19:13.186
He took my sister's life.

19:13.290 --> 19:15.084
I want to see
what was going through his mind

19:15.188 --> 19:18.364
when he was dying.

19:18.467 --> 19:21.643
Was there any regret or...

19:21.746 --> 19:23.886
was there only fear?

19:29.478 --> 19:31.377
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.932
I should get going.

19:35.035 --> 19:36.554
Okay.

19:40.040 --> 19:44.459
Maybe you could visit
some night for a bite to eat?

19:44.562 --> 19:48.842
It will be a year
next week, and...

19:48.946 --> 19:51.051
I feel like talking about her.

19:51.155 --> 19:53.433
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

19:53.537 --> 19:56.540
Um, maybe in
a week or two, though.

19:56.643 --> 19:58.852
We're still trying to get
settled in at the house,

19:58.956 --> 20:01.510
make it a bit more habitable.

20:01.614 --> 20:02.856
We?

20:02.960 --> 20:06.205
Yana, my girlfriend.

20:06.308 --> 20:09.208
You've met someone already?

20:09.311 --> 20:11.486
Well, I knew Yana
from the hospital.

20:11.589 --> 20:14.799
She's a pharmaceutical
rep there.

20:14.903 --> 20:20.288
When Dani died...
she was there for me.

20:23.912 --> 20:27.985
Um, maybe you could come
and visit us...

20:28.088 --> 20:30.850
if you think you're ready
to go back out there.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.925
M-Maybe.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.031
It was good to see you, Darcy.

20:40.135 --> 20:41.619
Goodbye.

21:00.983 --> 21:07.887
<i>Message received
11 months, 3 weeks, 1 day ago.</i>

21:07.990 --> 21:11.097
<i>Hey, guess what.</i>

21:11.200 --> 21:14.342
<i>We are connected.</i>

21:16.861 --> 21:19.692
<i>I found a signal.
Now, it's not ideal.</i>

21:19.795 --> 21:21.452
<i>It's only in one exact spot,</i>

21:21.556 --> 21:23.834
<i>but, uh, maybe we can
boost the signal?</i>

21:25.870 --> 21:28.148
<i>I don't know. I don't know
how those things work.</i>

21:28.252 --> 21:30.910
<i>I put the camera on a time
lapse, like you suggested,</i>

21:31.013 --> 21:34.465
<i>but so far,
all I've captured are orbs.</i>

21:34.569 --> 21:36.467
<i>I'd have thought
an old house like this</i>

21:36.571 --> 21:38.020
<i>would have at least one ghost
roaming around,</i>

21:38.124 --> 21:41.817
<i>but maybe the renovation work
scared them off.</i>

21:47.306 --> 21:50.550
<i>Ted's working hard
all the time.</i>

21:50.654 --> 21:52.483
<i>He's off tomorrow night,</i>

21:52.587 --> 21:55.659
<i>so the three of us
could have dinner, if you like.</i>

21:55.762 --> 21:56.867
<i>And, uh...</i>

21:59.110 --> 22:01.596
<i>that's about it here.</i>

22:01.699 --> 22:03.701
<i>I'm looking forward
to seeing you.</i>

22:03.805 --> 22:05.013
<i>I miss you.</i>

22:05.116 --> 22:07.878
<i>Okay. See you then.</i>

24:19.492 --> 24:21.598
...more dramatic terms,

24:21.701 --> 24:23.669
<i>the storm has
given back an ugly amount,</i>

24:23.772 --> 24:26.499
<i>Bringing with them rain
and gusty easterly winds.</i>

24:26.603 --> 24:27.707
<i>Nightfall, we'll see
the high possibility of</i>

24:27.811 --> 24:29.778
<i>weather-related power outages</i>

24:29.882 --> 24:32.125
<i>in the more exposed
rural areas of the Southwest.</i>

24:32.229 --> 24:33.989
<i>But providers have said
such outages...</i>

24:47.175 --> 24:48.279
Hey.

24:49.626 --> 24:51.282
How was your day?

24:51.386 --> 24:54.285
Long.

24:54.389 --> 24:56.287
You look tired.

24:56.391 --> 24:59.049
Well, I didn't
sleep last night.

24:59.152 --> 25:00.429
Yana.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.983
I keep telling you,

25:02.086 --> 25:03.812
I don't sleep
when I'm here alone,

25:03.916 --> 25:05.780
and because you're
still working nights,

25:05.883 --> 25:07.506
I'm here alone all the time.

25:07.609 --> 25:09.577
I know.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.888
Dr. Crotty
is going to retire soon,

25:10.992 --> 25:12.890
and then
I'll have regular hours.

25:15.962 --> 25:17.516
New camera?

25:17.619 --> 25:20.622
I found it clearing out
the store the other day.

25:20.726 --> 25:22.313
It's your wife's.

25:22.417 --> 25:23.832
That was Dani's?

25:23.936 --> 25:26.835
There's a lot of photos
of the two of you.

25:26.939 --> 25:28.147
I don't know
if you want to keep it or--

25:28.250 --> 25:30.183
No, it's all right.

25:30.287 --> 25:33.221
It's okay, Ted.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.223
It would be weird if you didn't
want to keep some memory of her.

25:37.363 --> 25:40.297
Okay. Okay, yeah.

25:40.400 --> 25:44.715
Maybe you could store it
somewhere safe for a while.

25:44.819 --> 25:47.062
Take a look
at these photos I took.

25:55.001 --> 25:57.728
What-- What am I looking at?

25:57.832 --> 25:59.316
Look at this one.

26:04.528 --> 26:06.392
You don't see her?

26:06.495 --> 26:07.773
Who?

26:19.785 --> 26:21.510
Well, it's Dani's camera.

26:21.614 --> 26:22.995
There's going to be
pictures of her on it.

26:23.098 --> 26:24.721
I took these two nights ago.

26:30.416 --> 26:34.316
Well, then it's double exposure
or whatever you call it.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.147
Okay.

26:37.250 --> 26:38.976
Last night,
when I was going to bed...

27:02.517 --> 27:04.346
Yana...

27:04.450 --> 27:08.799
I have to listen to crazy things
all night at work.

27:08.903 --> 27:11.284
I don't need to hear it
when I come home.

27:11.388 --> 27:13.839
Don't call me crazy.

27:13.942 --> 27:16.013
I'm just telling you what I saw.

27:16.117 --> 27:17.739
Dani's ghost?

27:17.843 --> 27:21.536
No. No, obviously not.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.263
But, clearly, the lack of sleep
is starting to affect me,

27:24.366 --> 27:26.230
which is why I want us
to move back to my apartment

27:26.334 --> 27:29.717
until you start
working regular hours.

27:29.820 --> 27:34.135
Fine.
If that'll make you happy.

27:34.238 --> 27:37.863
I don't like leaving you
out here on your own either.

27:37.966 --> 27:39.899
Then we're all good?

27:41.832 --> 27:44.214
But just to be clear,

27:44.317 --> 27:46.906
my dead wife
is not haunting this house.

27:48.701 --> 27:52.394
I know. I'm sorry.

27:52.498 --> 27:56.260
You sound like her sister--
with ghosts and nonsense.

27:56.364 --> 27:58.400
Speaking of her sister...

28:02.922 --> 28:04.337
It came today
while you were asleep.

28:04.441 --> 28:05.753
Dani's sister sent it.

28:05.856 --> 28:07.340
What's in it?

28:07.444 --> 28:09.411
I don't know. It's locked.

28:13.830 --> 28:15.866
Maybe she's inside it.

28:15.970 --> 28:18.144
No, she's outside.

28:20.319 --> 28:21.700
What?

28:26.877 --> 28:27.913
What's she doing here?

28:32.952 --> 28:36.197
Darcy. Hello.

28:36.300 --> 28:39.131
Ted.

28:39.234 --> 28:42.168
I'd forgotten how far out
this place is.

28:46.483 --> 28:50.349
Um... come in.

28:50.452 --> 28:52.040
Maybe you could guide me?

28:56.700 --> 28:58.909
- A step here.
- Thank you.

29:01.360 --> 29:05.364
Darcy, this is Yana.

29:05.467 --> 29:06.952
Yana, Darcy.

29:08.954 --> 29:11.715
It's-- it's nice to meet you.

29:11.819 --> 29:13.544
Hello.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.135
Uh, thank you for having me.

29:18.239 --> 29:19.827
Well, if I'd known
you were calling,

29:19.930 --> 29:21.552
I would have been ready.

29:21.656 --> 29:23.451
Ted didn't mention
he invited me?

29:25.833 --> 29:27.904
Uh, well, to be honest, Darcy,

29:28.007 --> 29:30.838
I didn't know
you were coming either.

29:30.941 --> 29:32.391
When did I invite you?

29:32.494 --> 29:33.979
Last week.

29:34.082 --> 29:35.532
When you came to the store,

29:35.635 --> 29:37.948
you said I should visit
on Dani's anniversary.

29:41.503 --> 29:43.747
Oh, I-- Okay. I'm sorry.

29:43.851 --> 29:45.887
If I said that,
I meant we'd arrange

29:45.991 --> 29:48.752
a night when we'd both be home.

29:48.856 --> 29:50.374
Are you not home now?

29:50.478 --> 29:53.826
Well, uh, no.
I-I'm on my way to work,

29:53.930 --> 29:56.208
and Yana is staying
in the city tonight.

29:59.314 --> 30:02.110
Well, I'm here now.
Can you call in sick?

30:02.214 --> 30:04.457
No.
I have people counting on me.

30:04.561 --> 30:07.219
We're short-staffed as it is.

30:07.322 --> 30:10.222
And I've got plans
in the city, so...

30:17.125 --> 30:18.920
I'm so sorry, Darcy. I can...

30:20.577 --> 30:22.475
I can drop you off on my way.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.145
I'm here now.

30:37.249 --> 30:40.666
I'd like to stay,
if that's alright.

30:40.769 --> 30:43.634
But we won't be here.

30:43.738 --> 30:45.360
That's alright.

30:45.464 --> 30:47.466
Well, I...

30:50.987 --> 30:53.127
Fine.

30:53.230 --> 30:57.234
Yeah, I suppose
that would be fine.

31:08.038 --> 31:09.937
I don't know.

31:12.422 --> 31:13.630
Oh.

31:13.733 --> 31:16.046
Your trunk arrived.

31:20.637 --> 31:22.535
What's in it?

31:29.542 --> 31:32.062
I'll see if we have
some extra blankets.

31:36.825 --> 31:39.656
Have I seen this before?

31:39.759 --> 31:41.692
It was my mother's.

31:41.796 --> 31:43.798
And you want me to have it?

31:43.902 --> 31:47.388
Yes.

31:47.491 --> 31:52.462
Are you sure?
I mean, if it was your mum's.

31:52.565 --> 31:56.535
She would be happy to know
I sent it here.

31:56.638 --> 31:58.433
Right.

31:58.537 --> 32:02.472
Well, thank you.
That's very, very generous.

32:05.199 --> 32:07.822
Can you show me
where the bathroom is, please?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.582
Of course.

32:13.103 --> 32:15.692
Thank you.

32:15.795 --> 32:18.246
Yeah, sorry again
for the mix-up.

32:18.350 --> 32:21.042
I feel bad leaving you here
on your own.

32:21.146 --> 32:23.872
Will you be alright?

32:23.976 --> 32:25.667
Don't worry about me.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.807
Well, you know,
I do sometimes.

32:27.911 --> 32:30.189
Think I've inherited it
from Dani.

32:30.293 --> 32:33.227
How is everything
with your health?

32:33.330 --> 32:35.022
- Why?
- No, you seem good.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.507
It's just anything
with the brain and cancer,

32:37.610 --> 32:41.407
it's something
to keep a close eye on.

32:41.511 --> 32:45.239
I had a checkup recently,
and all good.

32:45.342 --> 32:48.656
Good, good.
That puts my mind at ease.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.141
Okay, we're here.

32:53.281 --> 32:55.318
I'll see you in the morning.

32:55.421 --> 32:59.391
Yes, I'll-- I'll see you then.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.476
What are you doing,
telling her she can stay?

33:15.579 --> 33:18.272
I don't want her here.
- What do you want me to do?

33:18.375 --> 33:20.239
It's not my fault
she can't take a hint.

33:20.343 --> 33:21.620
Is it okay leaving her here
on her own?

33:21.723 --> 33:23.691
Well, I'd rather you
stayed here with her,

33:23.794 --> 33:25.175
but I get the feeling that's
not going to happen, so...

33:25.279 --> 33:27.315
- It's not.
- Well, there you are, then.

33:27.419 --> 33:30.111
She says she just
wants to be here.

33:30.215 --> 33:32.113
So what's the harm?

33:32.217 --> 33:34.253
And what the fuck
is that thing?

33:34.357 --> 33:35.944
Why would she want us
to have that?

33:36.048 --> 33:37.670
I have no idea.

33:37.774 --> 33:38.947
We'll get rid of it
as soon as she's gone.

33:39.051 --> 33:40.259
I have to go.

33:40.363 --> 33:41.640
Can you not wait
until I leave?

33:41.743 --> 33:43.469
I'm already late.

33:43.573 --> 33:46.990
Just say goodbye,
finish packing, and go.

33:47.094 --> 33:49.682
I'll see you in the morning.

34:07.459 --> 34:10.082
Did you know
the traditional gift

34:10.186 --> 34:12.912
to give a couple on their
fifth wedding anniversary

34:13.016 --> 34:14.983
is something made of wood?

34:15.087 --> 34:16.502
Ted and I aren't married.

34:16.606 --> 34:19.298
For my parent's
fifth wedding anniversary,

34:19.402 --> 34:21.818
a witch my mother knew
gave her that.

34:21.921 --> 34:24.269
It's very rare.

34:24.372 --> 34:26.340
Well, Ted and I
aren't married yet,

34:26.443 --> 34:29.653
so maybe you should
take it back.

34:29.757 --> 34:33.243
- Don't you like it?
- No.

34:33.347 --> 34:36.177
I find it a bizarre present
to give to someone.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.488
Okay, I am leaving.

36:20.592 --> 36:22.249
But Ted will be back
in the morning.

36:22.352 --> 36:25.493
I'm a little hungry.

36:25.597 --> 36:27.702
Maybe you could make me
something to eat

36:27.806 --> 36:29.911
before you leave.

36:30.015 --> 36:34.088
Uh, well, there's a fridge.

36:39.852 --> 36:42.200
Why did you take him
out of the box?

36:42.303 --> 36:45.479
I didn't.

36:45.582 --> 36:48.758
Okay.

36:48.861 --> 36:51.036
Yeah, so the fridge
is straight down to your right.

36:51.139 --> 36:52.589
Will you be able to find it?

36:52.693 --> 36:55.972
I'll find it.

36:56.075 --> 36:58.940
Good night.

36:59.044 --> 37:02.047
What did I do with my keys?

37:05.982 --> 37:08.571
Have you seen my keys?

37:42.881 --> 37:44.986
Did you find them?

37:45.090 --> 37:46.885
Would I be back here if I had?

38:24.854 --> 38:28.271
I can't find them.

38:28.375 --> 38:30.618
So you're staying, then?

38:30.722 --> 38:32.931
Well, I'm hardly walking back
to the city, am I?

38:33.034 --> 38:34.967
Wonderful.

38:35.071 --> 38:37.591
I was hoping the three of us
could spend some time together.

38:49.292 --> 38:51.846
We haven't gotten around
to building the kitchen yet,

38:51.950 --> 38:56.713
so we don't really keep
a lot of food here.

38:56.817 --> 38:58.681
If I'd known you were coming...

39:06.378 --> 39:07.931
How long have you and Ted
known each other?

39:08.035 --> 39:12.142
Two years.
We met at the hospital.

39:15.145 --> 39:18.597
You were a patient there.

39:18.701 --> 39:22.774
I'm a senior sales rep for
a major pharmaceutical company.

39:22.877 --> 39:25.880
I travel around a lot
of healthcare facilities.

39:25.984 --> 39:28.573
That's how I met Ted.

39:28.676 --> 39:31.403
And you became friends.

39:31.507 --> 39:36.132
We just found that we had
a lot in common.

39:36.235 --> 39:39.791
So there was nothing going on
between you two

39:39.894 --> 39:42.863
when my sister was still alive.

39:42.966 --> 39:47.902
- No. We were just friends.
- Okay.

39:52.804 --> 39:55.565
Ted said you work
in an antique store.

39:55.669 --> 39:57.705
It was my mother's.

39:57.809 --> 40:00.259
She gave it to me
after she passed,

40:00.363 --> 40:03.055
but it's not my main source
of income.

40:03.159 --> 40:06.093
I also read objects.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.715
What does that mean?

40:07.819 --> 40:09.752
It means
I can pick up an object

40:09.855 --> 40:12.375
and tell you everything
there is to know about it.

40:12.479 --> 40:14.412
- Like appraisals.
- People bring me

40:14.515 --> 40:17.760
their family heirlooms,
but it's more...

40:17.863 --> 40:21.695
A widow recently brought me in
her deceased husband's

40:21.798 --> 40:24.456
wedding ring.
She wished to know

40:24.560 --> 40:28.115
had he ever been unfaithful
in their marriage.

40:28.218 --> 40:31.946
He had been.
For years.

40:32.050 --> 40:34.121
Repeatedly.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.055
How could you tell that
from his wedding ring?

40:37.158 --> 40:39.644
By holding it.

40:39.747 --> 40:42.647
You could tell that this guy
was cheating on his wife

40:42.750 --> 40:45.166
by holding his wedding ring?

40:45.270 --> 40:46.547
Yes.

40:46.651 --> 40:48.653
Well, that's impossible.

40:48.756 --> 40:51.725
So, you're psychic?

40:51.828 --> 40:56.592
Personal items work best--
watches, rings,

40:56.695 --> 41:00.388
anything that has been
in close contact with the skin.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.253
Well...

41:03.357 --> 41:05.359
if you can make a living
from that,

41:05.463 --> 41:08.189
more power to you.

41:08.293 --> 41:10.709
Do you mind staying out here
alone at night

41:10.813 --> 41:12.677
when Ted's working?

41:12.780 --> 41:16.232
Can't say I enjoy it.

41:16.335 --> 41:19.338
Why not?

41:19.442 --> 41:22.272
Well...

41:22.376 --> 41:23.826
I suppose.
I think of what happened

41:23.929 --> 41:27.277
to your sister here and...

41:27.381 --> 41:31.074
Yeah, just the thought of
another one of Ted's patients

41:31.178 --> 41:33.663
showing up at the front door
here when I'm alone

41:33.767 --> 41:37.633
is just-- ugh.

41:37.736 --> 41:39.151
And if one were to knock
at the door,

41:39.255 --> 41:41.947
would you allow them in?

41:42.051 --> 41:45.641
Of course not.
Do I look stupid?

41:45.744 --> 41:48.885
I have no idea
what you look like.

41:48.989 --> 41:52.026
You sound stupid.

41:52.130 --> 41:54.442
Excuse me?

41:54.546 --> 41:56.962
Do I look stupid?

41:57.066 --> 41:59.931
No.

42:00.034 --> 42:02.140
My sister and I
were identical,

42:02.243 --> 42:05.833
so that must mean that
she didn't look stupid either.

42:05.937 --> 42:09.596
- I never said she did.
- You implied it.

42:09.699 --> 42:13.185
Dani would never allow
a strange man into her home

42:13.289 --> 42:16.464
in the middle of the night.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.433
Olin Boole
did not kill my sister.

42:29.167 --> 42:31.479
My God, I can't.

42:31.583 --> 42:34.448
I'm sorry.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.139
Maybe-- Maybe--

42:36.243 --> 42:42.732
Um, maybe they heard me
and I scared them away.

42:42.836 --> 42:45.770
Alright, I'll go into town.

42:45.873 --> 42:48.911
I'll call the police.

42:49.014 --> 42:53.398
You just
stand here by the door.

42:53.501 --> 42:56.574
You keep your eyes open.

42:56.677 --> 43:01.475
If you hear anything,
you pull this door open

43:01.579 --> 43:03.373
and you run.

43:08.033 --> 43:11.347
Well...

43:48.487 --> 43:49.972
Hey.

43:50.075 --> 43:52.422
Hey!

43:52.526 --> 43:54.355
Are you still there?

46:44.422 --> 46:46.734
Todd told me
that guy was put away

46:46.838 --> 46:48.495
for beating his mother to death.

46:48.598 --> 46:51.670
An abusive woman who had
already blinded him in one eye

46:51.774 --> 46:53.811
and was coming for the other.

46:53.914 --> 46:57.918
If I had only one working eye...

46:58.022 --> 47:00.196
I'd kill to protect it.

47:00.300 --> 47:03.786
If he didn't kill
your sister...

47:03.890 --> 47:07.100
who did?

47:40.788 --> 47:43.515
Did you fall out of bed?

47:45.863 --> 47:48.175
Were you praying?

47:50.039 --> 47:52.110
Couldn't sleep.

47:52.214 --> 47:54.423
That's not what I asked.

47:54.526 --> 47:57.184
Yeah.

47:57.288 --> 48:01.257
What were you praying for?

48:01.361 --> 48:03.708
For my mother.

48:03.811 --> 48:05.227
What's your name?

48:05.330 --> 48:08.678
Olin Boole.

48:08.782 --> 48:11.474
Olin. O-lin.

48:11.578 --> 48:14.408
Is that with an A or an I?

48:14.512 --> 48:17.342
An I.

48:17.446 --> 48:21.312
How do you spell that?
With one I or two?

48:21.415 --> 48:23.797
One.

48:26.765 --> 48:29.078
That'll be easy to remember.

48:29.182 --> 48:31.149
But you won't have to
remember it,

48:31.253 --> 48:34.946
because I'm being released
next week.

48:35.050 --> 48:37.880
Oh, so, you're only
passing through?

48:37.984 --> 48:40.296
I'm from the area.

48:40.400 --> 48:42.781
The halfway house won't be
available until next week.

48:42.885 --> 48:45.474
Where were you before this?

48:45.577 --> 48:47.407
Saint Delia's.

48:49.547 --> 48:51.583
How long were you there?

48:51.687 --> 48:54.241
17 years.

48:54.345 --> 48:59.212
Ohh.

48:59.315 --> 49:03.112
You're the fellow
who beat his mother to death.

49:03.216 --> 49:05.321
What the fuck are they doing

49:05.425 --> 49:08.773
letting someone like you
back out into the world?

49:08.876 --> 49:12.950
- Not going to hurt anybody.
- Get back into the bed.

49:18.438 --> 49:20.819
Don't let me catch you
out of it again.

49:26.653 --> 49:31.416
And how is it you're
the only one that knows this?

49:44.429 --> 49:48.640
Personal items work best.

49:57.442 --> 50:00.204
You ever been to Comercawn?

50:00.307 --> 50:02.620
No.

50:02.723 --> 50:05.278
It's where the boys' school
was, where I grew up.

50:05.381 --> 50:11.594
It's all overgrown now.
Nothing left of it.

50:11.698 --> 50:14.183
About 10 years ago,
someone put up a metal cross

50:14.287 --> 50:16.979
to mark the spot.

50:17.083 --> 50:20.293
I like to head down there
once a year,

50:20.396 --> 50:24.711
and I twist that cross
'round and 'round

50:24.814 --> 50:27.472
till it snaps off.

50:27.576 --> 50:31.718
They keep replacing it,
and I keep breaking it.

50:36.861 --> 50:40.106
I was thinking of heading
out there this weekend.

50:42.832 --> 50:45.697
Would you like to come?

50:45.801 --> 50:49.046
It's a lovely drive.

50:49.149 --> 50:51.565
We could make a day of it.

50:53.119 --> 50:56.467
No, I don't, uh...

50:56.570 --> 51:01.748
No, I try to catch up on sleep
on the weekends,

51:01.851 --> 51:04.820
spend time with Yana.

51:15.279 --> 51:18.903
Sister Francis
is buried out there.

51:19.006 --> 51:22.424
That blind nun I told you about.

51:24.598 --> 51:29.258
She used to tell us little boys
she went blind

51:29.362 --> 51:31.881
after God showed her
what hell looked like.

51:34.643 --> 51:37.887
Imagine that.

51:37.991 --> 51:41.512
Which reminds me,

51:41.615 --> 51:45.309
you never told me
your wife had a blind twin.

51:50.555 --> 51:52.454
What?

51:52.557 --> 51:56.803
You never told me your wife
had a blind twin sister.

51:56.906 --> 51:59.116
How do you know that?

51:59.219 --> 52:02.015
Well, I was in town
the other day

52:02.119 --> 52:04.811
and wandered into
this little antique shop,

52:04.914 --> 52:08.539
and
I nearly had a heart attack

52:08.642 --> 52:12.681
when I saw your dead wife
sitting there,

52:12.784 --> 52:16.167
what with her weird eyes
and everything.

52:16.271 --> 52:21.310
I thought I was
seeing her ghost.

52:33.046 --> 52:34.875
Rook to knight 6.

52:34.979 --> 52:36.498
Checkmate.

52:38.258 --> 52:40.364
Hello?

52:40.467 --> 52:42.883
I'm stuck out at the house.

52:42.987 --> 52:45.679
I can't find my car keys.
I've looked everywhere.

52:45.783 --> 52:47.267
Where's Darcy?

52:47.371 --> 52:49.373
We were talking,
and she fell asleep.

52:49.476 --> 52:51.651
She's saying some weird things
to me, Ted.

52:51.754 --> 52:53.653
What's she saying?

52:53.756 --> 52:56.449
Well, first of all,
she told me how she was psychic.

52:56.552 --> 52:59.866
And the next thing you know,
she pulls out a glass eye

52:59.969 --> 53:03.041
she says belongs to the man
that killed your wife.

53:03.145 --> 53:05.492
Only she says
he didn't kill your wife.

53:05.596 --> 53:09.841
She says it's that creepy,
orderly you work with-- Ivan.

53:09.945 --> 53:11.981
She said what?

53:12.085 --> 53:17.815
She said that Ivan killed Dani.

53:17.918 --> 53:20.231
What did she say exactly?

53:20.335 --> 53:23.683
That. Exactly what
I'm telling you.

53:23.786 --> 53:26.893
There's something going on there.

53:26.996 --> 53:29.033
She's clearly not well.

53:29.136 --> 53:31.277
I'm going to talk to her

53:31.380 --> 53:32.519
and see if she'll agree
to get checked out.

53:32.623 --> 53:34.521
I don't want to stay here
with her, Ted.

53:34.625 --> 53:36.627
I'm thinking about
calling someone to pick me up.

53:36.730 --> 53:38.525
And you've looked everywhere
for your keys?

53:38.629 --> 53:41.804
For all I know, she took them.

53:45.222 --> 53:47.672
And she's asking
a lot of questions

53:47.776 --> 53:50.261
about when you and I
got together.

53:50.365 --> 53:53.126
It has me on edge.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.955
Look, she's
not going to do anything.

53:55.059 --> 53:56.336
And even if she wanted to,

53:56.440 --> 53:58.718
I think you could handle
one small blind woman.

53:58.821 --> 54:02.756
Just say good night,
go to bed, and lock the door.

54:02.860 --> 54:06.450
I'm going to make some calls,
see if I can get out of here.

54:06.553 --> 54:09.487
Do, because she's freaking me
out with all this stuff.

54:09.591 --> 54:13.388
Why does she even know Ivan?

54:13.491 --> 54:17.530
I don't know.
I'll be there as quick as I can.

55:34.089 --> 55:35.711
Shit.

58:59.777 --> 59:03.160
Put them back!

59:03.263 --> 59:05.783
What is this?

59:05.887 --> 59:08.959
Put them all back now.

59:29.566 --> 59:32.707
Good night.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.338
What?

01:02:53.183 --> 01:02:55.841
<i>This is Dani Timmis
coming at you</i>

01:02:55.944 --> 01:02:58.257
<i>from the wilds of our
unfurnished sitting room.</i>

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.638
We've set up a little tent
here downstairs

01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:02.088
instead of going back
to the city,

01:03:02.192 --> 01:03:05.816
and I find it kind of
cozy and romantic.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.439
What do you think, Ted?

01:03:08.543 --> 01:03:12.202
- It's fucking freezing.
- Come on, show us your face.

01:03:12.305 --> 01:03:14.445
Let's see how, uh,
happy you look.

01:03:16.447 --> 01:03:18.035
<i>Oh!</i>

01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:41.541
<i>This is Dani Timmis
coming at you</i>

01:03:41.645 --> 01:03:44.372
<i>from the wilds of our
unfurnished sitting room.</i>

01:03:44.475 --> 01:03:46.684
<i>We've set up a little tent
here downstairs</i>

01:03:46.788 --> 01:03:48.272
<i>instead of going back
to the city,</i>

01:03:48.376 --> 01:03:51.897
and I find it kind of
cozy and romantic.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.277
What do you think, Ted?

01:03:56.142 --> 01:03:58.213
Run.

01:03:59.559 --> 01:04:01.251
Run!

01:04:36.355 --> 01:04:37.632
Darcy.

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:44.501
Darcy?

01:04:47.642 --> 01:04:49.161
Who's there?

01:04:57.238 --> 01:04:59.516
Is there someone in...

01:08:35.007 --> 01:08:36.491
Darcy.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.702
What are you doing up here?

01:08:46.777 --> 01:08:50.643
Yana's not answering her phone.
Where is she?

01:08:54.785 --> 01:08:57.271
Dani frightened her off.

01:08:57.374 --> 01:08:59.721
She always was
the more levelheaded one.

01:09:02.897 --> 01:09:06.659
Yana called me earlier.

01:09:06.763 --> 01:09:11.906
She said you told her
a man that works at the hospital

01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:14.460
with me killed Dani.

01:09:14.564 --> 01:09:17.808
Yes. A porter named Ivan.

01:09:19.603 --> 01:09:23.435
Do you know
who I'm talking about?

01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:25.816
There is an orderly
that works with me called Ivan.

01:09:28.302 --> 01:09:29.820
That's him.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:36.033
Olin Boole killed Dani.

01:09:36.137 --> 01:09:37.621
The week he was released,
he came out here

01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:38.795
and he killed her.

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.490
He came out here to save her,

01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:47.838
and I dragged him from his bed
and I killed him.

01:09:52.153 --> 01:09:53.844
I'm going to pay for that.

01:09:56.606 --> 01:09:59.195
Darcy, is something
affecting your thinking?

01:10:01.127 --> 01:10:03.647
Dani told me what you were like
when you were ill--

01:10:03.751 --> 01:10:07.306
seeing and hearing things
that weren't there,

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:10.378
believing things
that weren't real.

01:10:10.482 --> 01:10:13.657
This is not real.

01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:16.419
Why don't you come with me
to the hospital.

01:10:16.522 --> 01:10:17.834
I'll arrange a scan,
and we can see what's going on.

01:10:17.937 --> 01:10:21.700
To the hospital,
where you'll have me committed.

01:10:21.803 --> 01:10:23.909
No.

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:30.778
You know, I loved your sister,
so I owe it to her to help you.

01:10:30.881 --> 01:10:32.642
Yes, I could have you committed
if I thought you were a danger

01:10:32.745 --> 01:10:34.851
to yourself or to someone else.

01:10:39.373 --> 01:10:43.756
I am a danger... to Ivan.

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:48.002
So if you're going to send
someone out here to get me,

01:10:48.105 --> 01:10:50.798
send him.

01:10:54.595 --> 01:10:56.631
Where is all this coming from?

01:10:56.735 --> 01:10:59.427
Ivan and Dani never even met.
Why would he kill her?

01:11:03.949 --> 01:11:06.917
Because you asked him to.

01:11:07.021 --> 01:11:09.265
Excuse me?

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.759
"I don't love you anymore.
I've met someone else.

01:11:20.862 --> 01:11:22.761
I'm sorry."

01:11:25.971 --> 01:11:29.768
That was all you had to say.

01:11:29.871 --> 01:11:32.253
She would have cried,
and it would have been

01:11:32.357 --> 01:11:34.428
difficult, but I
would have been there,

01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:39.640
and she would have
gotten over you!

01:11:39.743 --> 01:11:44.852
But, instead, you had
Ivan come here and kill her.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:53.861
So, she'll be at the house
on Friday.

01:11:56.898 --> 01:11:58.728
Yes.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.425
Why don't you just
divorce her?

01:12:10.015 --> 01:12:13.156
She loves me.

01:12:13.259 --> 01:12:16.401
She'll never get over me.

01:12:16.504 --> 01:12:18.230
And when she finds out
about Yana,

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.645
there's no way
we'll get to keep the house,

01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:24.892
and I have sunk
everything into that place.

01:12:24.995 --> 01:12:26.859
This is the only way.

01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:41.080
Why don't you wait
until the place is furnished?

01:12:41.184 --> 01:12:44.636
Then it could look like
a robbery turned violent.

01:12:44.739 --> 01:12:48.985
No, no.
It'll be cleaner this way.

01:12:49.088 --> 01:12:51.194
Especially if you can do it
when she's inside the tent.

01:12:51.297 --> 01:12:53.472
Try to do it
when she's sleeping.

01:12:53.576 --> 01:12:56.855
What if the motive was sexual?

01:12:59.064 --> 01:13:01.411
It happens all the time.
The adrenaline kicks in.

01:13:01.515 --> 01:13:02.585
You have your hand
on their throat.

01:13:02.688 --> 01:13:05.415
No.

01:13:05.519 --> 01:13:08.418
No, nothing like
that is to happen.

01:13:08.522 --> 01:13:10.834
I want it to be
quick and painless.

01:13:13.492 --> 01:13:17.462
But let's just say it happens
to go that way.

01:13:18.946 --> 01:13:22.467
Nothing like that
is to happen to her.

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:23.778
Do you understand me?

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:27.472
You just go in there, you do it,

01:13:27.575 --> 01:13:30.129
and you get out of there
as quickly as possible.

01:13:30.233 --> 01:13:32.477
I mean it.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.651
I don't want her hurt.

01:13:36.273 --> 01:13:39.207
Just dead.

01:13:48.596 --> 01:13:52.669
I had planned to kill you,

01:13:52.773 --> 01:13:56.604
but instead, I think it would
be worse to expose you.

01:13:59.745 --> 01:14:05.233
I'm going to see to it
that you lose everything--

01:14:05.337 --> 01:14:07.650
your girlfriend,

01:14:07.753 --> 01:14:12.517
your job, this house,

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:15.554
your freedom.

01:14:15.658 --> 01:14:17.867
Detective Peter Minehan.

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:21.146
He was the police officer
in charge of Dani's case, yes?

01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:22.423
Do you remember him?

01:14:22.527 --> 01:14:27.635
- Yes.
- Do you trust him?

01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:29.810
- Yes.
- Okay, good. Let's start there.

01:14:29.913 --> 01:14:32.019
Let's call him,
and you can tell him everything

01:14:32.122 --> 01:14:35.091
that you've just told me
and see what his reaction is.

01:14:35.194 --> 01:14:38.059
He'll tell you it was
Olin that killed your sister

01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:41.753
and he'll walk you
through the evidence again.

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:42.892
You know,
if you're still not happy,

01:14:42.995 --> 01:14:45.550
then have him go question Ivan.

01:14:45.653 --> 01:14:47.034
Come on, let's call him.

01:14:47.137 --> 01:14:53.143
You call him,
you tell him what you did,

01:14:53.247 --> 01:14:57.838
and then call Ivan and send him
out here so I can kill him!

01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:00.392
I don't have his number here.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:04.672
Uh... I'm going to leave my phone
here, where there's signal,

01:15:04.776 --> 01:15:06.087
I'm going to go back
to the office,

01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:07.675
and I'm going to call
Detective Minehan

01:15:07.779 --> 01:15:10.851
and tell him to
call you here, alright?

01:15:10.954 --> 01:15:12.404
If you don't answer,
I'll tell him to come out here

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.579
and talk to you in person.

01:15:14.682 --> 01:15:21.206
But, please, when the phone
rings, pick it up.

01:17:05.793 --> 01:17:08.209
I had planned to kill you,

01:17:08.313 --> 01:17:13.111
but instead, I think it would
be worse to expose you.

01:17:13.214 --> 01:17:17.529
I'm going to see to it
that you lose everything.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:22.568
When the phone rings,
pick it up.

01:17:49.561 --> 01:17:52.737
Hey, doc.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.671
You said
you didn't talk to her.

01:17:55.774 --> 01:17:57.603
What do you mean?

01:17:57.707 --> 01:18:00.676
Dani's sister, Darcy.

01:18:00.779 --> 01:18:03.540
You said he didn't speak to her.

01:18:03.644 --> 01:18:05.094
I didn't.

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:10.996
Well, you spoke to someone,
because we have a problem.

01:20:11.565 --> 01:20:14.464
- Yes?
<i>- I found your phone.</i>

01:20:14.568 --> 01:20:17.329
<i>- And?</i>
- It's broken.

01:20:20.056 --> 01:20:23.473
Seems like it had a fall,
just like you thought.

01:20:23.577 --> 01:20:27.788
Is it still working?

01:20:27.892 --> 01:20:29.963
For now.

01:20:30.066 --> 01:20:32.482
But I don't think
it can be fixed.

01:20:32.586 --> 01:20:34.899
Are you sure?

01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:36.555
<i>It's beyond repair.</i>

01:20:45.185 --> 01:20:46.289
Hey.

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:49.810
Don't worry.

01:20:49.914 --> 01:20:52.433
It's nearly over.

01:21:09.761 --> 01:21:18.080
We... are... connected.

01:26:09.509 --> 01:26:13.271
Where were you?
Why am I here?

01:26:17.275 --> 01:26:19.277
What's this about?

01:26:19.381 --> 01:26:21.693
Based on your
prior convictions

01:26:21.797 --> 01:26:24.248
and my recommendation,

01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:27.147
it was decided that this was
the best place for you

01:26:27.251 --> 01:26:30.254
until you were in
a fit state to talk.

01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:31.841
Your recommendation?

01:26:34.568 --> 01:26:36.984
What happened at the house?

01:26:37.088 --> 01:26:39.608
Someone attacked me.

01:26:41.817 --> 01:26:43.370
Who?

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:52.552
I-I couldn't see.

01:26:52.655 --> 01:26:53.829
It was dark.

01:26:57.039 --> 01:27:00.422
You know, Darcy sent us this

01:27:00.525 --> 01:27:04.046
bizarre gift
of a large wooden man.

01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:05.737
When you woke up,
you told the nurse

01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:11.536
that a man made of wood
came to life and attacked you.

01:27:13.089 --> 01:27:16.161
Yes.

01:27:16.265 --> 01:27:18.750
What do you mean "yes"?

01:27:18.854 --> 01:27:19.924
That's what happened.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:22.444
If that thing was alive,

01:27:22.547 --> 01:27:24.342
how is it that
I was able to drag it outside

01:27:24.446 --> 01:27:28.760
and burn it without it
struggling or screaming in pain

01:27:28.864 --> 01:27:30.314
when I set it on fire?

01:27:30.417 --> 01:27:31.763
You burnt it?

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.837
It burned down quietly
to a pile of ash.

01:27:40.082 --> 01:27:43.534
The nurse also said
that you requested a priest

01:27:43.637 --> 01:27:46.640
and that you asked her
not to tell me that.

01:27:46.744 --> 01:27:49.264
Why do you want to see a priest?

01:27:54.579 --> 01:27:58.445
Why do you want to see a priest?

01:28:03.347 --> 01:28:07.351
- I want to confess.
- Confess to what?

01:28:07.454 --> 01:28:09.249
To all the things I've done.

01:28:09.353 --> 01:28:12.701
Oh, you've done
a lot of things, Ivan.

01:28:12.804 --> 01:28:16.636
You tell a priest just one
of the things you've done,

01:28:16.739 --> 01:28:18.189
and he'll either convince you
to go to the police

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:19.846
or he'll go there himself.

01:28:19.949 --> 01:28:22.158
You'll spend the rest
of your life in prison.

01:28:22.262 --> 01:28:24.195
It's better than
forever in hell.

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:26.266
There's no such thing
as forever

01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:28.441
and no such place as hell.

01:28:28.544 --> 01:28:30.097
I won't tell them
anything about you.

01:28:30.201 --> 01:28:34.067
I'll tell them I killed
your wife because I wanted to.

01:28:37.588 --> 01:28:39.762
People will question
how I failed to recognize

01:28:39.866 --> 01:28:44.836
such an obvious psychopath
and why I discharged it early.

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:50.117
Why I befriended it
and employed it.

01:28:50.221 --> 01:28:52.844
It'll make me look like
I'm not very good at my job.

01:28:57.642 --> 01:29:00.576
The one good thing about working
in a place like this...

01:29:02.406 --> 01:29:06.168
is that no one
really asks any questions

01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:08.757
except on the rare occasion

01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:13.451
that one patient died violently
at the hands of another.

01:29:13.555 --> 01:29:17.213
But even then,
as I've always believed,

01:29:17.317 --> 01:29:19.664
there's nothing
that can't be explained.

01:29:24.531 --> 01:29:28.604
No, no, please.

01:30:31.874 --> 01:30:33.531
<i>So, I'm not sure what part of
that you're not understanding.</i>

01:30:33.635 --> 01:30:35.602
<i>If I don't return your calls,</i>

01:30:35.706 --> 01:30:37.984
<i>it means I don't want
to speak to you.</i>

01:30:38.087 --> 01:30:40.469
<i>And if you think
I'm ever going to set foot</i>

01:30:40.573 --> 01:30:42.298
<i>in that haunted house
of yours again,</i>

01:30:42.402 --> 01:30:45.060
<i>then you're fucking crazier
than your patients.</i>

01:30:45.163 --> 01:30:47.511
<i>I mean, the fact that you have
no problem staying out there</i>

01:30:47.614 --> 01:30:51.687
<i>where two people have now died
is just so weird.</i>

01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:55.795
<i>Do not call me again.</i>
