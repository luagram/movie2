WEBVTT

01:40.468 --> 01:41.669
Oh, shit.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.483
What are you doin' after this?

02:30.484 --> 02:33.353
No plans.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.492
Good morning.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.996
We're having lunch
with the Rousseau's.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.065
Who?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.501
The French couple.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.770
We met them yesterday.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.538
Oh, great.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.408
What story should
we tell them?

05:08.676 --> 05:09.843
You invited 'em.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.080
How about the OCD story?

05:15.282 --> 05:16.416
That one's fun.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.184
We haven't used it in awhile.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.752
Okay.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.723
But this time, you're
the one with OCD.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.825
You're better at it.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.130
Why was I mad at you?

05:31.131 --> 05:33.901
Uh, I think it works
better when you don't say.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.571
Hm.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.807
Come here.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.109
I need help with my necklace.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.029
Couldn't make these
things any smaller, huh?

06:03.030 --> 06:06.399
It'll be nice to have
lunch with another couple,

06:06.400 --> 06:07.735
like normal people.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.705
That's us, normal people.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.607
Hm.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.810
Are you feeling okay?

06:18.479 --> 06:19.879
Yeah.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.450
Yeah, just had that dream again.

06:24.051 --> 06:24.952
Oh.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.354
Prague?

06:28.355 --> 06:29.490
Hm.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.260
That was a fair fight.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.029
You sucker shot me.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.069
How do I look?

06:47.307 --> 06:49.375
Like you need to
come back to bed.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.217
Joe is one of those
men who can't understand

06:58.218 --> 07:00.352
how anyone could
ever be mad at him.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.054
She was probably
just sick of my shit.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.255
I was, I was.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.757
I was sick of his
shit and I decided

07:04.758 --> 07:06.392
that it was time for him to go.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.127
Mm hm.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.329
So she takes all my clothes,
she throws 'em on my bed,

07:10.330 --> 07:11.864
tosses my suitcase at me.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.399
He's making me
sound irrational.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.767
Please.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.670
So, my favorite
part of this story.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.172
- Lara has-
- Joe has OCD.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.741
<i>Oh</i> .

07:21.742 --> 07:23.543
- I have OCD.
- That's a problem.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.845
Yeah, just a little bit.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.846
- Mild OCD.
- Right.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.214
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:28.215 --> 07:30.249
You're mildly
obsessive compulsive.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.718
- Oh my God.
- Mm hm.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.719
I can see that a little bit.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.020
When he's packing, everything

07:34.021 --> 07:36.823
has to be folded
exactly the right way.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.390
I mean, one wrong crease,

07:38.391 --> 07:41.561
and he's gotta start the
whole process over again.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.663
- I do like clean lines.
- I know you do.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.664
Yeah.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.799
So it took you, what,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.468
four hours to fold
all of your clothes?

07:49.469 --> 07:53.640
And then by the end we
were just so exhausted.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.175
- Yeah, we were.
- We just made up.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.577
We made up.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.680
I mean, after she admitted
she was overreacting.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.248
I was really tired
and I just wanted

08:02.249 --> 08:03.349
to go to bed, actually.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.552
Oh.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.787
So, where are you
from originally?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.722
I grew up all over.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.423
I actually was
raised in Brazil.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.659
Oh.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.760
- My mom is Brazilian.
- What?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.728
Yeah, I swear to you.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.800
So, you are from Brazil
and you are from?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.433
American.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.468
Okay.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.704
So, how did you guys meet?

08:24.705 --> 08:27.439
Joe actually came to San Paulo
on business.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.975
Mm hm.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.910
And he didn't know
anything about the culture.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.145
He introduced himself
to me in Spanish.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.380
Ooh.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.951
He said he screwed up

08:38.952 --> 08:39.952
in Portuguese.
- That's right.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.420
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

08:41.421 --> 08:45.291
So, it seems you
were destined to meet.

08:45.292 --> 08:49.730
Destiny is an old
French word, right?

08:50.163 --> 08:50.930
Yeah, yeah.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.231
Never heard of that one.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.933
- Yeah.
- Roland, how's your leg?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.836
Yeah, it's a
sprain I'm afraid.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.705
Quite painful, but...

08:58.706 --> 09:00.439
A mild strain.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.641
Don't be dramatic.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.975
But at least I
don't have to go

09:02.976 --> 09:05.145
on this little
trek in the woods.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.080
Roland hates nature.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.549
I just prefer not to
interact with it, right?

09:18.091 --> 09:20.559
Well, you know, Bridgette,
you should come with us.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.861
<i>Yeah?</i>

09:21.862 --> 09:23.396
It's a wonderful idea.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.832
Yeah.

09:25.833 --> 09:26.933
It would be lovely.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.434
-  <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.568
Thank you.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.536
<i>Leave him at home.</i>

09:32.105 --> 09:33.673
- Drink, don't be droll.
- I'll order room service.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.252
You should get ready.
Bridgette's gonna be here soon.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.159
You still looking
for that plane?

09:55.128 --> 09:58.130
Whoever it is, they're
not here for us.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.733
It wouldn't be that obvious.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.735
Right.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.738
I guess I'll just hang around

10:05.739 --> 10:08.141
and pretend I have OCD all day.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.413
I'm sorry, it was too easy.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.282
I saw your expression

10:16.283 --> 10:18.617
when I invited Brigitte
to come with us.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.652
Oh.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.920
Oh, you mean Destiny?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.122
She's great.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.391
The best.

10:25.392 --> 10:29.162
Okay, I'll take that
answer at face value.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.630
"Destiny.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.800
It's a French word."

10:33.801 --> 10:35.135
I'll be right back.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.208
Brazil, huh?

11:05.899 --> 11:08.501
Lara, how you doin' in there?

11:18.578 --> 11:20.279
So it's not us,
it's a local issue,

11:20.280 --> 11:23.049
but I'm on standby so
I can't go on the tour.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.616
Fine, fine, we'll
just go tomorrow.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.552
But then Bridgette
would have to go alone.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.755
Oh, you mean you can't
go, not we can't go?

11:28.756 --> 11:31.124
You should still
go on the tour.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.593
This isn't a vacation.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.129
You're workin' a mark.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.967
Honey, it's both.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.269
Huh.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.376
Fine, fine, I'll go.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.144
I'll go (sighs).

12:11.932 --> 12:13.665
- I don't want to impose.
- Oh, no, no,

12:13.666 --> 12:15.034
you're not imposing.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.235
Joe's really looking
forward to it.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.703
- Really?
- And I'm sure

12:17.704 --> 12:18.971
I'll feel better after I
just have a little nap.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.139
- Ready?
- Yeah.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.841
- Good.
- All right.

12:21.842 --> 12:22.909
- Oh.
- Mwah.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.076
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.879
Gloves on. Bye.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.070
After World War II
ended,

12:51.071 --> 12:52.771
Sobchak returned from exile

12:52.772 --> 12:55.842
to live out his days
on his ancestral land.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.276
It was in this modest house

12:57.277 --> 12:58.878
that he wrote his
most renowned works,

12:58.879 --> 13:01.814
including "Worthy Adversary."

13:47.627 --> 13:49.229
<i>No, no!</i>

14:02.009 --> 14:03.276
<i>Right this way.</i>

14:06.613 --> 14:10.216
I didn't know there was
an airport close to here.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.118
There's not.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.687
Is that hail?

14:41.814 --> 14:42.950
Lara?

14:44.584 --> 14:45.485
Lara?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.189
That's near them, no?

14:50.190 --> 14:51.958
The smoke and...

14:51.959 --> 14:53.892
I don't know.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.768
Bridgette, you should
go back to the resort.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.270
It's not safe.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.871
No, I'm a doctor.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.007
I can help.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.576
Please, go back.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.347
<i>What is it?</i>

15:15.582 --> 15:17.084
What the hell?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.119
<i>What the fuck?</i>

15:37.804 --> 15:39.172
They got shot.

15:43.576 --> 15:47.013
Hey everyone, just go
back to the resort, okay?

15:47.014 --> 15:49.248
Yes, that's a good idea.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.018
I will wait for the police.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.187
Come, I'll
get you to the resort.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.430
Joe, who did that?

16:04.431 --> 16:07.433
Where's the person who did that?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.368
Yeah.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.904
- Look at-
- Just be careful.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.407
What are these markings?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.210
What is that?
- Oh, shit.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.447
He's a professional.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.315
Profession what?

16:25.152 --> 16:28.054
It's working.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.121
Is that good?

16:29.122 --> 16:31.323
Right?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.294
Yeah, not for me
it's not (grunts).

16:45.405 --> 16:47.306
Oh, hey Joe.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.940
Where'd you find this place?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.610
What was this, a fuckin'
Toys"R"Us or somethin'?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.612
- Shit.
- What do you got?

16:53.613 --> 16:55.214
<i>We just
picked up a floater.</i>

16:55.215 --> 16:56.748
Okay.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.017
<i>Okay, just be careful.</i>

16:59.018 --> 17:00.619
<i>What
are these markings?</i>

17:00.620 --> 17:02.422
<i>He's a professional.</i>

17:04.091 --> 17:05.857
Yeah, and he's one of ours.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.793
And he's been missing
for five years.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.061
Who's the Frenchie?

17:09.062 --> 17:10.829
Ah, she's no match.

17:10.830 --> 17:11.798
Where are they?

17:12.665 --> 17:13.965
Poland.

17:13.966 --> 17:16.001
We just picked that up
off of a CESSNA Radio.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.836
It's a DEA plane.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.471
Anybody from DEA
reached out to us?

17:19.472 --> 17:20.872
No. His voice ain't

17:20.873 --> 17:23.376
gonna match anything
in their database.

17:23.910 --> 17:24.843
Want me to send it over?

17:24.844 --> 17:26.178
Fuck no.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.114
Get me the DEA
file on the CESSNA

17:28.115 --> 17:31.283
and get me a list of the
closest arbiters, all right?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.519
Copy.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.133
What are you doing?

17:49.136 --> 17:51.337
He might have swallowed it.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.339
Swallowed what?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.741
Whatever got him killed.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.509
No, Joe!

18:13.260 --> 18:14.394
Come on.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.198
Come on.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.032
Go back to the resort.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.201
- But I-
- Hey,

18:22.202 --> 18:23.169
the shooter's still out here.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.304
Go.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.539
Come on.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.543
<i>What is that?</i>

18:32.779 --> 18:33.680
Flight pill.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.001
Look, there they are.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.370
<i>You see them?</i>

18:59.406 --> 19:00.507
No.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.675
But everything must be okay,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.644
otherwise they'd be running.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.948
Yeah, you say it, but you
don't look very convincing.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.823
All right, we have five
arbiters in the region.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.790
Okay.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.426
Who's senior?

19:20.427 --> 19:23.630
Chester.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.132
Who else?

19:27.133 --> 19:28.634
Chester.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.035
I don't want to talk
about Chester, okay?

19:30.036 --> 19:31.503
Chester is messy.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.640
Well, he's
less than two hours out.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.009
Lemme tell you a story.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.311
Archibald?
- Yeah.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.812
Guy on the tape,

19:40.813 --> 19:44.316
five years ago he goes
to Warsaw, routine work.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.617
Nothing exotic.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.886
He gets shot, kidnapped,

19:47.887 --> 19:50.256
never resurfaces,
never checks back in.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.690
So, what do we do?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.726
We list him as out of
the office indefinitely

19:54.093 --> 19:57.430
like we always do
and boom, he's back.

20:00.099 --> 20:04.504
Do you think it's possible
that he may have joined Alarum?

20:27.494 --> 20:29.061
Just keep your mouth shut.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.872
We were waiting
for the police.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.910
There isn't any
need for the police.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.821
What happened here?

20:56.823 --> 21:00.192
We were on the Sobchak
tour when the plane crashed,

21:00.827 --> 21:02.929
came to see if they
needed any help.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.865
And did they?

21:07.033 --> 21:09.502
They were dead
when we got here.

21:16.943 --> 21:17.844
You are quiet.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.585
Why would an attractive
woman like you

21:26.886 --> 21:29.121
come into the woods
looking for a crash?

21:30.222 --> 21:31.658
You must be a nurse.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.834
I speak French, too.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.173
But I know you understand me.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.910
You looked annoyed when
I said you were a nurse,

21:52.445 --> 21:53.780
and not a doctor.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.392
Do you speak French, too?

22:09.729 --> 22:13.433
No. French, they say that's
destiny.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.836
Ah, you're American.

22:18.838 --> 22:19.739
Yeah.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.174
Did you take anything?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.310
No.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.349
You don't think I
will shoot you too?

22:31.350 --> 22:34.119
Oh no, I think
you'll shoot me.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.988
they'll just search
the plane first.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.425
And find what?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.567
American stoicism.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.470
I admire that quality.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.672
What is your name?

22:53.573 --> 22:54.674
Joe.

22:56.042 --> 22:56.976
American Joe.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.358
<i>Fire!</i>

23:25.004 --> 23:26.906
<i>What was that?</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:30.076
I'll be right back.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.165
We have to go.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.103
Roland, now.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.171
Come on.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.286
Yeah?

24:15.588 --> 24:17.489
<i>Call home.</i>

24:17.490 --> 24:18.758
Alright.

24:26.365 --> 24:27.299
Hello?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.101
<i>Location?</i>

24:30.102 --> 24:31.603
Slovakia.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.805
Aren't I lucky?

24:34.507 --> 24:35.473
<i>Status?</i>

24:35.474 --> 24:37.342
I'm open for business.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.510
<i>Excellent.</i>

24:38.511 --> 24:39.879
<i>Please hold for the Director.</i>

24:42.649 --> 24:44.349
Chester.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.885
This is Burbridge.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.988
We have a location on Archibald.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.925
Archibald? Wow.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.895
We worked a lot together.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.131
Is that a conflict
of interest?

25:02.168 --> 25:03.102
No, it's okay.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.203
Good.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.973
I would like you to
depart immediately.

25:07.974 --> 25:08.908
Okay.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.244
We think he's joined Alarum.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.746
Alarum?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.648
<i>Have you confirmed that?</i>

25:16.649 --> 25:18.918
Well, it's not
confirmed, but...

25:20.720 --> 25:22.021
Please terminate him.

25:24.824 --> 25:25.925
<i>Chester?</i>

25:27.193 --> 25:28.094
Right.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.673
Do you have anything
they can use as a weapon?

25:41.674 --> 25:44.042
No.
I don't know.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.112
No, there's no
weapons here that...

26:01.460 --> 26:05.396
Okay, listen, you hold
the knife like this.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.934
Roland, fuckin' pay
attention to me.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.069
You're gonna hold it like this.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.004
You're gonna jam the
knife right here.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.505
You're gonna thrust it
in as hard as you can.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.174
You're gonna dig it in,
you're gonna turn it.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.509
You really wanna cut
the whole neck open.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.111
Whose neck?
What?

26:20.112 --> 26:21.847
Whoever comes
through that door.

26:21.848 --> 26:22.914
Lock the door behind me.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.816
What about Bridgette?

26:24.817 --> 26:27.053
If she's alive, Joe'll
take care of her.

26:28.554 --> 26:31.322
Roland, you have to focus.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.225
Think about Bridgette,
think about going home.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.794
That's how you're
gonna get through this.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.863
Yeah, yeah.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.231
Okay.
- Lock the door.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.902
Yeah.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.769
We identified a yellow
jacket file, an assassin.

30:04.770 --> 30:05.904
Codename Orlin.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.205
I've read that guy's file.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.773
Yeah, well, he
was on the plane.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.575
The exact plane that
Archibald's voice showed-

30:10.576 --> 30:12.410
Why are all these
computers 25 years old now?

30:12.411 --> 30:13.912
Yeah, well, I just wanted
to put this out there.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.313
I think they're
workin' together.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.647
No, they're not
working together.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.316
Archibald never
works with anybody.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.085
Yeah, well, this
is what I'm thinkin'.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.120
We have Orlin and
Archibald already there.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.389
Chester is on his way, right?
- Yeah.

30:24.390 --> 30:27.225
Who the fuck knows
what the DEA is gonna do?

30:27.226 --> 30:28.326
We have an arbiter.
- Uh huh.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.460
We have a yellow jacket

30:29.461 --> 30:31.462
and a possible member of Alarum.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.100
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah, so I'm just thinkin'.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.301
It feels like we're
building a bomb.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.104
Great, whose bomb is it?

30:39.438 --> 30:40.838
- Ours.
- Your bomb, okay?

30:40.839 --> 30:41.974
Fuck.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.228
You go any further,

31:03.229 --> 31:05.396
he'll pick your men
apart one by one.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.733
You run out of men before
he runs out of bullets.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.002
What should we do?

31:26.685 --> 31:28.354
American Joe!

31:31.123 --> 31:34.426
I think you understated
your military training!

31:37.396 --> 31:39.365
I'm sending my
men to the resort.

31:40.732 --> 31:44.702
I assume you did
not come here alone.

31:44.703 --> 31:48.674
The person waiting for you
will be dead by morning.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.453
Leave a few of your men
scattered as snipers.

32:02.454 --> 32:06.157
You and the rest come
with me to the resort.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.823
These are the location
coordinates you provided.

32:38.824 --> 32:41.593
- Are we near the town?
- Just behind us a bit.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.897
- You can put it down now.
- Copy that.

32:46.898 --> 32:48.933
Hey, what do your
wife and kids think

32:48.934 --> 32:50.235
about you flying all the time?

32:50.236 --> 32:52.303
Do they ever get nervous?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.472
No, Sir, I'm not married.

35:16.982 --> 35:19.750
The American did
not return to forest.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.753
We think he's
headed for village.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.231
He's looking for
resources to fight.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.400
Send some men.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.470
Tell the rest of your men
to go from cabin to cabin.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.438
Grab the guests.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.573
Bring them here.

35:43.074 --> 35:45.777
The authorities have
probably been contacted.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.515
My employer will handle that.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.384
Nobody is coming
for these people.

36:05.564 --> 36:06.932
<i>Roland, it's me.</i>

36:08.033 --> 36:09.099
Lara?

36:09.100 --> 36:10.535
<i>Hurry up, Roland.</i>

36:10.536 --> 36:12.237
I'm coming <i>.</i>

36:12.238 --> 36:13.538
Okay.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.307
Can you run on that ankle?

36:16.275 --> 36:17.875
Come on, I need quick answers.

36:17.876 --> 36:18.743
Yes or no?

36:18.744 --> 36:19.777
No, it's gonna hurt too much.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.178
Get under the bed.
Go on.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.348
When soldiers come in here,
you don't make a sound.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.515
You stay still.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.450
Get down.
- What soldiers?

36:25.451 --> 36:26.518
Hurry up.

37:03.755 --> 37:06.458
Come on, come on, come on.

38:33.278 --> 38:35.646
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

39:34.406 --> 39:36.073
<i>Deputy Director,</i>

39:36.074 --> 39:38.443
<i>we have somebody on
the house line for you</i> .

39:38.444 --> 39:39.945
<i>Somebody named Archibald.</i>

39:42.581 --> 39:43.749
Put him through.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.385
<i>Go ahead
for the Director.</i>

39:48.386 --> 39:50.154
Hello, Burbs.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.522
<i>Hey, Archie.</i>

39:51.523 --> 39:54.859
What, it's been like five years.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.261
You takin' the long way home?

39:57.262 --> 39:58.663
It's Joe now.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.765
<i>Well, excuse me.</i>

40:00.766 --> 40:02.733
Where are you?

40:02.734 --> 40:04.869
Come on, you know where I am.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.605
So what's the play, Joe?

40:08.807 --> 40:10.809
What do you know
about the plane?

40:12.911 --> 40:15.646
Joe, gimme one second.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.948
Kirby, gimme the
yellow jacket file

40:17.949 --> 40:20.819
on Archibald's last
target in Prague.

40:23.221 --> 40:27.725
<i>Joe, we are actually assembling
data on the plane right now.</i>

40:27.726 --> 40:29.160
You know Orlin's here?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.963
<i>You know he was on the
plane before it went down.</i>

40:32.964 --> 40:34.465
There was chatter here that you

40:34.466 --> 40:35.866
and he might be
working together,

40:35.867 --> 40:37.702
and of course I
reassured everyone that

40:37.703 --> 40:40.571
that could not
possibly be the case.

40:40.572 --> 40:41.807
<i>Well, it's not.</i>

40:43.642 --> 40:46.244
But I do know why he
was on that plane.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.314
And now you show
me your cards.

40:50.315 --> 40:53.283
<i>You know I watched Orlin
gut one of the pilots.</i>

40:53.284 --> 40:56.654
He pulled a flash drive
from a man's stomach.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.855
<i>Okay.</i>

40:57.856 --> 40:59.790
<i>Flight pill?</i>

40:59.791 --> 41:02.960
I don't know what's on it,

41:02.961 --> 41:06.031
but I do know if Orlin is
involved it must be important.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.500
<i>Who chartered the plane, huh?</i>

41:09.501 --> 41:10.968
<i>DEA?</i>

41:10.969 --> 41:14.639
We're thinkin'
along those lines.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.308
Tell you what,
call off Chester.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.679
Gimme a few hours, I'll
retrieve the flash drive.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.718
In exchange for what?

41:28.887 --> 41:30.789
I want you to forget about me.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.358
Yeah.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.126
I tell you what,

41:37.996 --> 41:39.964
<i>we will forgive you your sins</i>

41:39.965 --> 41:42.232
<i>in exchange for the flash drive</i>

41:42.233 --> 41:47.706
<i>if you tell me your exact
relationship with Larissa Moss.</i>

41:51.242 --> 41:52.177
I married her.

41:54.379 --> 41:56.781
You fuckin' what?

41:56.782 --> 42:00.050
Tell Chester to meet
me at Trekker Hunting.

42:00.051 --> 42:02.620
<i>It's down the street
from his hotel.</i>

42:02.621 --> 42:04.089
Wait a second, you...

42:31.482 --> 42:33.684
Parked the Jeep in the
forest 10 meters due east.

42:33.685 --> 42:36.420
If another Jeep pulls up out
front, they shouldn't see it.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.689
If they come looking
for their men,

42:38.690 --> 42:40.390
they're gonna see
the dead bodies.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.626
Then they're gonna
assume that you took

42:41.627 --> 42:43.260
the Jeep and you fled.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.730
I don't know who's out
there or how many there are.

42:45.731 --> 42:48.298
We should be safe here for now.

42:48.299 --> 42:49.466
Get in the wardrobe.

42:49.467 --> 42:50.534
You're gonna hide in there.

42:50.535 --> 42:51.702
You're not gonna move.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.271
You're not gonna make a sound.

42:54.105 --> 42:54.939
Okay.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.140
You got the keys to the Jeep.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.242
We only use it as a last resort.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.811
Why are you helping me, Lara?

43:00.812 --> 43:02.313
That doesn't matter now.

43:06.852 --> 43:08.119
Archibald

43:10.722 --> 43:12.457
married the assassin

43:13.158 --> 43:14.491
who shot
- Oh, shit.

43:14.492 --> 43:15.360
and kidnapped him.

43:16.394 --> 43:20.998
Well, if that's true,
then she's gotta be there.

43:20.999 --> 43:23.934
Yeah, and guess what?

43:23.935 --> 43:27.437
You get to call your
friends in the DEA.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.273
So you want me to reopen
the yellow jacket file?

43:29.274 --> 43:31.008
Absolutely. We have to find
out A,

43:31.009 --> 43:32.643
who she's working for,

43:32.644 --> 43:36.481
and B, if she in fact
is working Archibald.

43:37.282 --> 43:40.417
Well, maybe they're just
both working for Alarum.

43:50.495 --> 43:52.629
Hello?

43:52.630 --> 43:54.631
Well, I think I
officially jinxed the trip.

43:54.632 --> 43:58.335
Never should have said
literary museum sounds boring.

43:58.336 --> 44:00.070
Where are you?

44:00.071 --> 44:01.973
The town about 10 miles north.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.743
<i>Orlin's here.</i>

44:05.076 --> 44:07.778
Yeah, yeah, Chester too.

44:07.779 --> 44:10.214
<i>What's the plan?</i>

44:10.215 --> 44:12.783
Let's rendezvous
at the Sobchak house.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.952
Oh, you'll be underwhelmed.

44:14.953 --> 44:17.154
Can you go there now?

44:17.155 --> 44:18.588
I got somethin' to
take care of first,

44:18.589 --> 44:19.858
then I'll come.

44:20.692 --> 44:22.793
Stay alive.

44:31.069 --> 44:32.636
<i>Suspend your mission.</i>

44:32.637 --> 44:33.971
<i>Give Archibald enough time</i>

44:33.972 --> 44:35.840
<i>to retrieve the flight pill.</i>

44:35.841 --> 44:37.174
Okay.

44:37.175 --> 44:40.410
And after he retrieves it?

44:40.411 --> 44:43.014
<i>Archibald
cannot come home again.</i>

44:45.183 --> 44:48.887
<i>If Larissa Moss is
there, eliminate her too.</i>

44:50.588 --> 44:51.890
You got it.

44:52.891 --> 44:54.925
Moron.

44:59.164 --> 45:00.664
- What?
- How?

45:00.665 --> 45:02.132
What the fuck?

45:09.340 --> 45:10.975
<i>Strange.</i>

45:52.717 --> 45:53.852
Oh.

46:01.192 --> 46:02.960
How you doin', kid?

46:02.961 --> 46:05.095
This vacation's goin' great.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.598
Burbridge send you
here to cheer me up?

46:08.599 --> 46:10.134
He did.

46:10.135 --> 46:12.970
He said you're lookin'
for some stupid thing,

46:12.971 --> 46:14.873
like a flight pill.

46:16.041 --> 46:17.608
You haven't found
it yet, have you?

46:19.277 --> 46:20.178
Nope.

46:21.847 --> 46:23.547
Perfect.

46:23.548 --> 46:24.950
I'll help you find it.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.417
Perfect.

46:27.418 --> 46:29.520
- Yeah.
- You look tired.

46:32.757 --> 46:36.862
Hey, do not judge
your book by its cover.

46:37.762 --> 46:39.864
So, you quit?

46:39.865 --> 46:41.532
Did you join Alarum?

46:42.633 --> 46:43.934
Would it even matter?

46:43.935 --> 46:46.136
No, no, I'm just
being curious.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.905
I'm just chit chattin'
and all that shit.

46:47.906 --> 46:49.607
Whoa, vodka.

46:51.442 --> 46:54.811
This is what the doctor ordered.

46:54.812 --> 46:59.150
How 'bout we toast our
rekindled friendship.

47:00.685 --> 47:01.552
Here we go.

47:04.622 --> 47:06.590
A toast to hell.

47:06.591 --> 47:10.929
May our stay there, be as much
fun as our way there again.

47:13.498 --> 47:14.966
Mm.

47:20.138 --> 47:21.272
That your work?

47:22.207 --> 47:24.509
It is, yeah.

47:25.676 --> 47:27.111
What'd you use?

47:27.112 --> 47:28.778
I cannot tell you
my friend,

47:28.779 --> 47:31.181
because you're not part
of the club anymore.

47:31.182 --> 47:32.349
Oh, right.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.919
Mm hm.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.620
Friendly on the helicopter?

47:36.621 --> 47:39.457
That's gotta be some
kind of bad mojo.

47:40.225 --> 47:41.992
I don't think so. I mean,

47:41.993 --> 47:45.262
he wasn't married and
there's no collateral damage.

47:45.263 --> 47:47.465
- Hm.
- I wanna ask you somethin'.

47:48.699 --> 47:52.269
Why are you trying so hard
to retrieve this flight pill?

47:52.270 --> 47:54.572
You think it's gonna
be your ticket home?

47:55.974 --> 47:57.374
No.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.776
Good, you're smart
'cause it's encrypted.

47:59.777 --> 48:00.945
You're never gonna crack it.

48:00.946 --> 48:02.948
You, me, nobody.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.685
My wife's at the resort.

48:08.786 --> 48:09.687
I need help.

48:10.688 --> 48:11.589
For what?

48:13.691 --> 48:15.126
Orlin's here.

48:19.597 --> 48:20.498
He's here?

48:23.168 --> 48:25.169
That fool's still around.

48:25.170 --> 48:28.338
Burbridge forgot that part.

48:28.339 --> 48:30.475
I'm gonna have to
raise my rates.

48:31.109 --> 48:32.210
Excuse me.

48:33.311 --> 48:34.512
I gotta freshen up.

49:04.109 --> 49:05.976
Whew.

49:05.977 --> 49:07.378
Oh.
- What is it?

49:09.014 --> 49:10.147
What is what?

49:10.148 --> 49:11.148
I was in there freshening up.

49:11.149 --> 49:12.282
Oh, come on, Chester.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.883
I'm not that outta practice.

49:13.884 --> 49:15.020
What is it?

49:18.856 --> 49:19.757
Is it new?

49:24.762 --> 49:25.663
Hm.

49:27.032 --> 49:29.699
Yeah, it's definitely new.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.736
That poor chopper pilot
was the test subject.

49:33.204 --> 49:34.471
And?

49:34.472 --> 49:36.507
It's the worst
stuff we've ever made.

49:37.408 --> 49:39.110
Quick but painless.

49:40.678 --> 49:41.579
Really?

49:44.082 --> 49:45.416
Don't get stuck.

49:54.759 --> 49:55.792
Was that necessary?

50:02.733 --> 50:05.369
Hey, you wanna
put that gun down?

50:05.370 --> 50:06.403
We're friends here.

50:06.404 --> 50:07.605
I'm here to help you.

50:08.773 --> 50:09.939
Right.

50:59.857 --> 51:02.559
When I checked in here, the
old man at the desk said,

51:02.560 --> 51:05.061
"What's in the bag?"

51:05.062 --> 51:06.763
Hey, you're slippin'.

51:06.764 --> 51:09.733
This is bad luck to
leave liquor in a glass.

51:09.734 --> 51:11.768
And you think it's a good
idea to drink before a shootout?

51:11.769 --> 51:14.871
I can't think of a
better time in theory.

51:14.872 --> 51:16.106
All right.

51:16.107 --> 51:17.242
Mm.

51:18.876 --> 51:20.144
Ah.

51:20.145 --> 51:23.381
This is an AA-12.

51:24.182 --> 51:26.816
Now, the only flaw
with this weapon

51:26.817 --> 51:28.919
is that makes
everything too easy.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.488
So, why don't you put
that peashooter down

51:31.489 --> 51:33.957
and pick up one of these

51:33.958 --> 51:35.426
and let's cause some damage.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.362
There you go.

51:38.363 --> 51:39.963
Good to work with you again,
Chester.

51:39.964 --> 51:41.299
Yeah, yeah.

52:10.528 --> 52:12.563
They refuse to
go after American.

52:15.433 --> 52:18.769
Why do they think it's
an option not to fight?

52:21.038 --> 52:22.707
He has heavy artillery.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.719
Tell them I'm on my way.

52:38.223 --> 52:39.389
Hey, Chris.

52:39.390 --> 52:40.957
Ronald, how are you?

52:40.958 --> 52:42.158
What's up, man? What do you
think of the new place?

52:42.159 --> 52:43.660
You've done a great job, man.

52:43.661 --> 52:45.595
Thank you.
I did it all myself (chuckles).

52:45.596 --> 52:47.096
Oh, you look good.
- Thanks, buddy.

52:47.097 --> 52:49.299
But I need you to tell
me what information

52:49.300 --> 52:50.268
you have on my 206.

52:51.236 --> 52:55.505
Oh. Well, what information do
you have on the flight pill?

52:55.506 --> 52:57.407
Buddy, I'm not that easy.

52:57.408 --> 52:59.276
Ronald, why don't you start?

52:59.277 --> 53:02.479
What kind of classified
bullshit triggered this meeting?

53:02.480 --> 53:03.880
A loose arbiter?

53:03.881 --> 53:04.882
No?

53:05.316 --> 53:07.117
We need that flash drive back.

53:07.518 --> 53:10.320
Strictly DEA. Has nothing
to do with you guys.

53:10.321 --> 53:12.155
Oh, really? That will
be determined

53:12.156 --> 53:14.157
when I get my eyes
on the flash drive,

53:14.158 --> 53:16.059
and I've got people
looking for it right now.

53:16.060 --> 53:18.462
And believe me, I will be
taking a close look at it

53:18.463 --> 53:20.797
before I turn it
back over to you.

53:20.798 --> 53:23.468
Well, that's assuming
that you guys get it.

53:25.336 --> 53:26.871
Kirbs, gimme a second.

53:28.906 --> 53:29.807
Thanks, buddy.

53:30.741 --> 53:32.008
Chris, I was hoping you

53:32.009 --> 53:33.477
and I could work
together on this.

53:33.478 --> 53:35.011
We can man, I'm here.

53:35.012 --> 53:36.946
I'm listening, but you
gotta gimme somthin'.

53:36.947 --> 53:38.081
- Okay.
- Yeah.

53:38.082 --> 53:39.783
Here's what I'm dealing with.

53:39.784 --> 53:43.520
I've got an ex arbiter that
I think has joined Alarum.

53:43.521 --> 53:45.054
Are you tellin'
me Alarum exists?

53:45.055 --> 53:46.990
Is that what the company's
feeding you guys?

53:46.991 --> 53:48.157
Yes.

53:48.158 --> 53:49.759
What are these guys?

53:49.760 --> 53:51.428
- I don't know, maybe.
- Rogue spies, vigilantes?

53:51.429 --> 53:52.429
- I don't fucking know.
- Who the fuck are they?

53:52.430 --> 53:53.730
But listen to me.

53:53.731 --> 53:56.633
The intelligence indicates yes.

53:56.634 --> 53:59.102
Oh, that changes
the game, doesn't it?

53:59.103 --> 54:01.971
Yeah.
Basically it means I'm fucked.

54:01.972 --> 54:04.775
Okay look, I can't tell
you everything I know,

54:05.576 --> 54:08.177
but I will tell you
everything that I can.

54:08.178 --> 54:09.145
All right?

54:09.146 --> 54:10.580
Sure.

54:10.581 --> 54:14.083
So I want you to
take a look at this

54:14.084 --> 54:17.455
'cause I'm adding one
name to this list today.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.490
This is a Alarum's
suspected roster?

54:20.491 --> 54:22.191
Yeah.

54:22.192 --> 54:23.192
Fuck, man.

54:23.193 --> 54:24.561
What do these guys want?

54:24.562 --> 54:25.862
Well, if you
believe the rumors,

54:25.863 --> 54:27.464
they want to tear
down the tyranny

54:27.465 --> 54:30.500
of the global
intelligence network.

55:03.934 --> 55:06.235
It's okay, I'm here to help.

55:06.236 --> 55:07.604
- Oh, thank God.
- Be quiet.

55:07.605 --> 55:09.406
I'll be back.

55:09.407 --> 55:11.075
You can't just leave us.

55:23.087 --> 55:24.521
Oh, there it is.

55:24.522 --> 55:27.156
The English, unattractive.

55:27.157 --> 55:29.459
Yeah, well, you wouldn't
win the prize anyway, huh?

55:29.460 --> 55:30.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:35.199 --> 55:36.165
Did you hear that?

55:46.611 --> 55:49.012
Someone cut off
yours Yuri's dick.

55:49.013 --> 55:52.449
Someone cut off-
- I see that.

55:52.450 --> 55:54.818
Someone's trying
to intimidate you.

55:57.455 --> 55:58.855
It's working.

56:32.690 --> 56:34.758
Go get hostages.

56:34.759 --> 56:36.092
I will execute them one by one

56:36.093 --> 56:38.529
until coward comes
out of hiding!

57:15.566 --> 57:16.734
Hands up!

57:19.537 --> 57:20.771
Turn around.

57:21.472 --> 57:22.573
Slowly.

57:26.176 --> 57:27.711
Check her.

59:02.139 --> 59:05.575
Why are your men hiding when
I am paying them to fight?

59:05.576 --> 59:08.411
The American, he has help.

59:08.412 --> 59:09.779
There are two in there.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.781
Two Americans
against all your men.

59:11.782 --> 59:13.116
And their weapons
are much better-

59:13.117 --> 59:14.051
Shh.

59:19.423 --> 59:20.658
Bring your men here.

59:21.692 --> 59:22.726
Come, come.

59:22.727 --> 59:23.861
Come.

59:27.965 --> 59:30.635
You are afraid of
what is in there?

59:32.603 --> 59:33.870
Take your men.

59:33.871 --> 59:35.673
Wait for me at the
hotel entrance.

59:37.541 --> 59:38.643
Go.

59:49.053 --> 59:50.755
Do you understand now?

59:51.722 --> 59:53.189
Hm?

59:53.190 --> 59:55.524
You will die out here
if you refuse to fight.

59:55.525 --> 59:57.828
Better to take your
chances in there.

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:16.714
I am what you must fear.

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:19.883
The American may
offer you death,

01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:21.118
but I guarantee it.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:32.797
What's Orlin doing?

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:35.966
He's killing his own men.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:37.801
That figures.

01:00:37.802 --> 01:00:39.302
God, I'm hungry.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.937
I don't know about you, but I
need some

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:42.138
pancakes, a French toast.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:43.841
Fun food, something.

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:48.678
Whoa.

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:50.715
Who worked you the fuck over?

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.550
Got that five years ago.

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.220
Well, I hope you killed him.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.023
<i>All men, over here!</i>

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:01.290
Married her, actually.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:02.759
What?

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.694
Come on.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.162
It was before she knew me.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.765
Oh, guys, somehow
I feel happy for you

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:11.067
and bad for you
at the same time.

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:14.503
We have a very good
marriage counselor.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.941
How do you know
she's not playing you?

01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:19.709
Even though it would
be a perfect ending

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.746
that you're the dumb Pooh bear
who fell into the honey pot.

01:01:22.747 --> 01:01:26.115
Well, she was already a
double agent when we met, so.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.884
At least it's not boring.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:29.252
Right.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.755
And then she joined
Alarum, right?

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:32.889
Yes.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.190
Hm, what about you?

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.793
No, no, I wanted
out, so I'm out.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:40.129
But here I am stuck in
this shit with you anyway.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.031
She'll
get to you kid.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.100
She'll convince you for sure.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:47.304
Oh, yeah, well, she's tryin'.

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:51.041
Hm, I think it's time.

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:56.245
What's he doin' now?

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.247
Yeah, he hasn't
taken his position yet.

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:01.085
Yeah, well, he'll let
his men be up front.

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:03.287
He is a coward.

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:06.556
- Yeah.
- Oh, God damn.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.493
My back, my back is tight.

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:12.962
You do me a favor,
Arch, seriously.

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:14.397
It's embarrassing.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:15.531
Could you pull me up
just a little bit?

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:16.433
It locks up.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.703
Hate to admit that.
- Jesus Christ.

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:22.071
Come on.
- Thank you.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.373
Ah, shit!

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:27.476
You crazy bastard.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:28.912
Sorry, kid.

01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:30.579
You got about an hour.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.915
Antidote?

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:33.350
Not for you <i>.</i>

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:42.392
Chester, you
said you'd help me.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:46.462
Chester?

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:48.965
I'm here, right?

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:51.334
And you won't be able
to do this alone.

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:54.503
So, your wife's got an hour.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:55.439
Don't waste it.

01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:04.747
Not for nothin'.

01:03:04.748 --> 01:03:07.650
The final hour won't be boring.

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:20.063
When you go in, do not stop.

01:03:20.064 --> 01:03:21.931
This is not your home.

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:24.233
Inflict as much
damage as you can.

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:26.069
If your bullets
do not kill them,

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:28.037
the shattering
glass will cut them,

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:30.539
or the exploding walls
will distract them.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.441
If we have to, we will
demolish the building

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.510
until it crashes down on them.

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:36.880
Shoot the windows.

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:51.260
These assassins operate
in controlled chaos.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:55.231
We are not here to unleash
chaos, we are here to define it.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:12.748
Go, go, go!

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:45.448
Get down.

01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:48.953
Time to move.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:52.788
More.

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:54.123
More <i>.</i>

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:01.030
Go!

01:05:11.475 --> 01:05:13.077
Ever use a frag grenade?

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.178
No?

01:05:15.179 --> 01:05:16.746
Impressive.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.092
<i>Shit.</i>

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:32.195
What?

01:05:32.196 --> 01:05:35.131
You had it the whole time, Arch?

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.532
Chester, Chester.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.269
Chester!

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.971
No.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:55.519
There.

01:05:59.123 --> 01:06:02.091
You Americans think
you're the only

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:04.128
well trained killers
in the world.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.896
- I'm German.
- Oh.

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:10.634
And I'm the best trained
killer in the world.

01:06:12.236 --> 01:06:14.237
Yuri was my friend.

01:06:14.238 --> 01:06:15.372
Who's Yuri?

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.010
The man you mutilated.

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:27.217
What is this?

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:37.426
You can stop this
by calling American.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:39.296
Tell him to turn
over flash drive.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.731
- He's my husband.
- Oh.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:45.734
And nobody can
make him do anything.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:53.709
Perhaps you can explain
situation to him in a way

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.581
that he will understand.

01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:01.385
Okay.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:05.722
Gimme the SATCOM and
I'll explain it to him.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:09.359
Show me before you send.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.263
Who do you work
for (groaning)?

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:02.338
I'm not working.

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:04.341
I'm on my honeymoon.

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:09.446
You work for them?

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.220
Alarum.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.222
Alarum?

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:22.759
It means to call to arms.

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:30.366
We don't work for a single
country or government.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:32.269
We work for ourselves (panting).

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:38.908
Is it too late to join?

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:03.700
Your application's denied.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:10.973
There is a French citizen
staying at the resort.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:12.207
A Roland Rousseau.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.510
His bank is suspected
of laundering money

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:15.778
for an arms dealer.

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:18.180
- Okay.
- He's pretty clean himself but,

01:10:18.181 --> 01:10:19.548
you know Alarum. They could be

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.351
actively recruiting him to join
the group.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:24.420
That bolsters the idea
that Archibald and Moss

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:25.621
are working for Alarum.

01:10:25.622 --> 01:10:27.323
Maybe. But let's say

01:10:27.324 --> 01:10:30.726
Archibald finds the flash drive,

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:34.162
turns it over to foreign
intelligence or Alarum.

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.532
What are we lookin' at?

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.400
Bottom line.

01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:38.934
- Bottom line?
- Mm hm.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:40.403
Half of the network's
operation can get unmasked.

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:41.537
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:41.538 --> 01:10:42.905
Say that again.
- You heard me.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:45.609
Half of the network's
operation can get unmasked.

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:47.876
Yeah.

01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:50.980
This flash drive needs to
come home or disappear.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.951
You pick.

01:10:57.621 --> 01:11:00.789
Hey, guess what?

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.393
You get to target
Archibald's coordinates.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.234
Holy smoke, God damn it.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:44.868
God!

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.313
Shit.

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:15.230
Shit.

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:16.700
American Joe.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:21.571
You again (exhales).

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:25.675
I underestimated you.

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:27.677
Oh.

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:34.817
What is your field name?

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:37.153
A little weak comin' in
at the end, don't you think?

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:42.024
Never trade longevity
for bravado.

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:44.292
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:46.194
I worked under Archibald.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.297
Yes, I've heard of you.

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.066
You disappeared.

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:52.101
I quit (sighs).

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.072
Bad timing
for all this then, eh?

01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:58.273
Yeah.

01:12:58.274 --> 01:12:59.609
Where is the flash drive?

01:13:03.447 --> 01:13:05.714
What's on it?

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.984
What does it matter
to people like us?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.122
Chester, he has it.

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:15.290
Chester.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:17.292
He's a part of the Old Guard.

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.595
Why is he...

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:23.066
The Americans sent him
to kill you.

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:26.670
Yeah, appears
that way (grunts).

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:30.205
And now where will he go?

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:33.910
Back to the lodge, try
to kill my wife (exhales).

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:41.016
We're both double
crossed tonight.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.885
It should have been
a simple exchange,

01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:45.954
but an undercover DEA
agent overplayed his hand.

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:47.790
Thought he had me
trapped by altitude.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:50.192
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:53.161
You shot down a
plane you were in.

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.597
Why not?

01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:56.431
I was the only one
with the parachute.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.734
Shit.

01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:01.638
I have no use for
intricate strategies, huh?

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.573
Barbarism works.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.510
Yeah, clearly.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.982
You can't leave without
the flash drive.

01:14:14.518 --> 01:14:15.785
Job's binding.

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:20.989
You're gonna need
help with Chester.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.992
Your local guys
can't handle him.

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:42.111
Not a full cease fire.

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:49.653
A recess, yes?

01:14:52.756 --> 01:14:54.189
Until the bell rings (groans).

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:55.124
Yes.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.060
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:58.061 --> 01:14:59.796
Joe.

01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:01.329
All right.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.264
Yeah, great.

01:15:02.265 --> 01:15:03.365
Okay.
- Yeah.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:04.700
Drone the strike is set.

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:07.035
Chris, thanks for comin' by.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.204
I need a minute with
Agent Kirby here, okay?

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:10.739
See you guys.
- See you next time.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.875
- See you guys.
- All right, take care. Yeah

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:16.879
Okay, we need a cleaning
crew on the ground.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.481
I want to be first when
this thing is over, okay?

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:20.816
They don't get the credit

01:15:20.817 --> 01:15:21.850
when we've done
all the dirty work.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.951
Got it.

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:24.119
I'll find a local company.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.754
- Keep it simple.
- Yeah.

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:26.755
If money's a problem, tell
them we write

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:27.890
the biggest checks.

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:29.558
If they need their asses kissed-

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:31.159
We got the biggest lips.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.096
Look at you with the
fuckin' jokes, all right?

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:35.898
No U.S. equipment can
be used, all right?

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:37.332
All right, cool.

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:39.001
Look, I've already
found a charter company,

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:40.102
Ascendia Charters.

01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:41.270
Excellent.
All right.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:43.772
Tap into the sweetener fund
for our Polish friends.

01:15:43.773 --> 01:15:45.340
It is very important

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:47.643
that our complete
non-involvement

01:15:47.644 --> 01:15:49.612
is understood and appreciated.

01:15:49.613 --> 01:15:50.679
Okay, you got that?

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.115
- Copy.
- All right.

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:55.218
Hey, we need a cleaning
crew on the ground.

01:15:56.419 --> 01:15:59.889
Yeah. Find out who in the
area can get us access.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.362
Yeah?

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:08.631
<i>I have Ascendia
Charters on the line.</i>

01:16:08.632 --> 01:16:10.032
<i>There's a problem.</i>

01:16:10.033 --> 01:16:11.935
<i>You have to hear
it for yourself.</i>

01:16:12.836 --> 01:16:13.937
Okay.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.505
Hello, this is Ronald Burbridge

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.808
with the National
Clandestine Service

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:22.077
of the United States of America.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.146
What is the fucking problem?

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:26.514
Just like I told your friend.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:31.821
I have a team of local
cleaners and one helicopter.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:34.023
Fine, I only need
one helicopter.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:39.327
Look, your name
alone isn't enough anymore.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.729
<i>Sir,
the problem is that</i>

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:43.198
<i>we're not the only bidder.</i>

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:44.499
Excuse me?

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.103
Four of you, one whirl.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:52.607
<i>I've got a guy from another
United States agency.</i>

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:56.244
<i>He won't even give me his name
or tell me where he's from.</i>

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:58.446
Okay, fine, we'll
outbid all of them.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:03.518
That's what
you all are saying.

01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:04.820
Galligaskins.

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:06.421
<i>Look it up.</i>

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:12.060
Oh, fuck!

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:13.896
Send Kirby in here.

01:17:13.897 --> 01:17:15.464
Jesus Christ!

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:19.668
<i>Sir, there's an
Archibald on the line for you.</i>

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:20.769
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.105
<i>His phone's about to die.</i>

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.041
Yeah, he always says that

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.811
when he's gonna hang up on me.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.146
Patch him through.

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:33.816
<i>Go ahead
for the Director.</i>

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:34.951
You lied to me.

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:38.788
Hey, would you
hold on a second.

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:43.658
What's the status
of the drone strike?

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.261
Strike's impending.

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:49.766
Hello, Joe.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.935
<i>You know how we
deal with traitors?</i>

01:17:52.936 --> 01:17:55.038
No, I never
compromised my country.

01:17:57.841 --> 01:17:59.607
For a foreign agent?

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:02.845
She follows the same code
as we do, you know that.

01:18:02.846 --> 01:18:04.079
Oh, yeah.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.814
What code is that?

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:06.949
Alarum?

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.718
Right.

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:11.319
You know what?

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.023
I really tried to stay outta
the fray on this, I did.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.659
So I'll tell you what.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.898
After I kill Chester,
I'm comin' for you.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:26.334
I happen to know that
Chester has the flash drive.

01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:29.404
I also happen to know
that Chester gave you

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:32.574
a shot of KR-45,

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:35.477
and that you will be
dead before dinner.

01:18:41.885 --> 01:18:43.585
He didn't take the bait?

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:46.089
No, I didn't even
have time to give it.

01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:48.925
Just your location.

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:52.160
Yeah, but that
doesn't do him any good.

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:55.064
He can't get men here in time.

01:19:00.003 --> 01:19:02.538
He doesn't trust Chester
to bring it back.

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:08.211
He's gonna kill us all.

01:19:10.513 --> 01:19:12.414
- He's in the village.
- Okay.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:14.116
He's gonna head
for the resort,

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:16.051
so have the drones light
up the travel routes.

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:17.619
Yeah, we just got word.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.422
The hostages escaped.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:21.623
That makes
no fuckin' sense.

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:23.025
Yeah.

01:19:23.026 --> 01:19:24.526
Or maybe, I guess
it does because it's

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:26.361
a whole fuckin shit show.
- Shit show.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:27.295
Yeah.

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:28.997
One more thing.
- Yeah?

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:30.732
I want you to add a little
finisher to the drone strike?

01:19:30.733 --> 01:19:31.834
Copy.

01:19:31.835 --> 01:19:32.835
Let's light it up.

01:19:32.836 --> 01:19:33.768
Make it a burn zone.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:34.904
Yeah.

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:51.634
Shit.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:55.604
Lara?

01:22:58.141 --> 01:23:00.475
Hey, they're comin' back.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.045
They are heat seekers.

01:23:03.746 --> 01:23:06.281
Fire, fire.

01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:07.815
Fire, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.651
His books, his books.

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:13.188
Come on.

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:14.256
Light?
- Yes.

01:23:14.257 --> 01:23:15.724
Yes.
- Yeah.

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:20.828
You know, historically
this whole burn

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:23.765
a book thing doesn't
work out for people.

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:45.287
Come on.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.267
See anything?

01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:00.403
No.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:07.943
Hey!

01:24:18.621 --> 01:24:19.721
Fuck!

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:25.327
We gotta get outta here.

01:24:25.328 --> 01:24:27.061
We gotta get outta
this fuckin' house.

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:28.531
Let's go. Fuck.

01:24:29.198 --> 01:24:30.299
Come on.

01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:04.399
Got him.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.435
Yes, you did, American Joe.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:09.305
Congratulations.

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:15.478
As I said before,
barbarism works.

01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:28.491
Run!

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:05.528
What are you doing' after this?

01:26:09.265 --> 01:26:10.799
No plans.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:21.377
No plans.
- Yeah, me too.

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:33.054
No, don't
look at me like that.

01:26:33.055 --> 01:26:34.622
You're lying.

01:26:34.623 --> 01:26:36.525
All right, I'll accept
that answer at face value.

01:26:39.628 --> 01:26:42.464
Let's get you down here.

01:26:42.465 --> 01:26:44.799
Let's go home, okay?

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.503
Hey, you can shave
my head, ink me up.

01:26:48.504 --> 01:26:50.772
Hey, hey, hey, you hear me?

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:52.341
Come on, come on, stay with me.

01:26:53.242 --> 01:26:56.143
I'm in, okay?

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:59.381
You're gonna need
references (chuckles).

01:26:59.382 --> 01:27:02.250
No good.

01:27:02.251 --> 01:27:03.386
About time.

01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:06.689
Took you long enough.

01:27:08.624 --> 01:27:10.793
It's almost time, Arch.

01:27:13.262 --> 01:27:14.462
Sorry.

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:16.365
How much time do I have?

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.434
Just about a minute.

01:27:19.435 --> 01:27:20.636
It's not exact.

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:24.272
Well, you mind?

01:27:24.273 --> 01:27:26.909
I need you to
throw the pistol.

01:27:29.612 --> 01:27:31.245
One more time <i>.</i>

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:32.448
Clock's running.

01:27:37.953 --> 01:27:39.788
All righty.

01:27:40.623 --> 01:27:42.056
What, what?

01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:44.993
I (coughing)...

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:47.963
For awhile.
- Awhile?

01:27:48.964 --> 01:27:50.433
I lied.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:54.503
What does he mean
you only have a minute?

01:27:55.371 --> 01:27:56.638
Poison.

01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:58.172
He stuck me.

01:27:58.173 --> 01:27:59.374
What?

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:00.643
Where is it?

01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:03.645
He thinks.

01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:10.052
<i>What?</i>

01:28:16.492 --> 01:28:17.593
How?

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:21.830
How?

01:28:24.166 --> 01:28:25.633
Oh.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:31.005
You know, Chester,
I saw that pilot die.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:33.476
I knew it was some
kind of poison.

01:28:34.443 --> 01:28:36.978
I really did (groans).

01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:40.582
And then, you know,
I had time to go look

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:42.651
through your hotel room.

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:48.790
Yeah, I knew that
stuff in the vial

01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:53.094
looked like water when I tried
to put it in the syringe.

01:28:53.095 --> 01:28:54.829
Oh, shit.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.031
Oh, fuck (exhales).

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.337
You put it in the vodka.

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:04.806
Good, smart.

01:29:04.807 --> 01:29:08.643
You never did leave
a glass un-drunk.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:11.112
Gimme the anecdote.

01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:12.079
Come on.
- This?

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.047
Give it to me.

01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:13.981
Oh, come on.

01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:17.018
Listen, you're
gonna need help.

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:19.286
If you're goin' to
war against Burbridge,

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.088
you're gonna need friends.

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:23.191
You don't have any,
I'm just saying.

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:25.927
Oh, God damn.

01:29:25.928 --> 01:29:28.596
Look, Burbridge betrayed me too.

01:29:28.597 --> 01:29:30.331
Be nice.

01:29:30.332 --> 01:29:34.402
Give me the antidote and I'll
join the team, I promise.

01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:37.338
I'll kill as many
of 'em as I can.

01:29:37.339 --> 01:29:38.540
I'll kill 'em all.

01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:40.575
You know, I mean that, Arch.

01:29:40.576 --> 01:29:41.710
Come on.

01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:46.848
Fuck it, I deserve it.

01:29:46.849 --> 01:29:47.783
You win.

01:29:48.784 --> 01:29:50.284
Just take off.

01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:51.554
You do deserve it.

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:55.823
You do, but I need you.

01:29:55.824 --> 01:29:57.860
So you're gonna bring
every black bag there is.

01:30:00.429 --> 01:30:02.931
I'll bring 'em all.

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:11.372
Good move.

01:30:11.373 --> 01:30:12.774
Good move, Arch.

01:30:17.713 --> 01:30:19.380
Ah, shit.

01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:20.515
Here's the cleanup crew.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.222
Help, help.

01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:29.156
That's help.

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:30.958
It works.
