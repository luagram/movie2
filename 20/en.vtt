WEBVTT

01:00.894 --> 01:04.333
"I am the way
into the city of woe.

01:08.732 --> 01:13.901
"I am the way into eternal pain.

01:13.902 --> 01:17.477
"I am the way
to go among the lost.

01:17.478 --> 01:22.082
"Before me, there were
no created things.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.519
"But those that last forever.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.021
"As do I!

01:31.022 --> 01:35.463
"Abandon all hope
you who are about to

01:39.763 --> 01:42.404
You are now in the presence

01:43.370 --> 01:45.869
of the motherfuckin' king!

02:05.995 --> 02:07.627
You ready, John?

02:14.035 --> 02:15.063
Yeah.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.744
Move! John wick!

04:17.961 --> 04:19.594
Mr. Wick.

04:21.431 --> 04:23.499
To what do I owe the pleasure?

04:31.237 --> 04:32.541
My ring.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.643
My freedom.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.314
Your ring is gone,

04:40.315 --> 04:42.111
like the elder before me.

04:44.222 --> 04:45.352
And if you came here thinking

04:45.353 --> 04:47.451
you could end this
by killing me,

04:47.452 --> 04:49.217
then you are mistaken.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.153
My death will not
change the outcome

04:52.154 --> 04:55.157
any more than you can
change your nature.

04:56.192 --> 04:59.630
None of us
can escape who we are,

04:59.631 --> 05:02.505
and no one escapes the table.

05:03.899 --> 05:05.737
And the only way John wick

05:05.738 --> 05:09.545
will ever have freedom
or peace, now or ever,

05:10.608 --> 05:11.910
is in death.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.749
I know.

05:18.851 --> 05:22.184
I'm afraid you've come
a very long way

05:23.060 --> 05:24.087
for nothing.

05:26.325 --> 05:27.596
Yeah...

05:32.036 --> 05:33.261
Not really.

06:23.616 --> 06:25.984
The manager, please.

06:35.325 --> 06:39.129
A harbinger is here
to see you, sir.

06:40.131 --> 06:42.063
This must be a mistake.

06:42.064 --> 06:43.930
There is no mistake.

06:43.931 --> 06:45.505
By order of the Marquis,

06:45.506 --> 06:48.003
Vincent bisset de gramont,

06:48.004 --> 06:50.074
this hotel has been condemned.

07:01.852 --> 07:04.154
You have one hour.

07:15.934 --> 07:17.365
He is expecting you.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.141
Can they do this, sir?

07:25.142 --> 07:28.376
The decree is signed
by the 12 members of the table,

07:29.583 --> 07:31.551
giving the Marquis

07:31.552 --> 07:33.346
the power of <i>autem imperator,</i>

07:33.347 --> 07:38.188
which means he is
now our judge, jury and...

07:41.196 --> 07:42.929
Evacuate the hotel.

08:00.851 --> 08:03.517
Ned Kelly's final words
as the hangman slipped

08:03.518 --> 08:05.688
the noose
around his neck were...

08:06.916 --> 08:09.682
"Such is life."

08:09.683 --> 08:12.890
Can you imagine
the acceptance,

08:12.891 --> 08:15.698
Today is not the day
you will die.

08:16.499 --> 08:18.263
Of that, I am sure.

08:18.264 --> 08:21.698
You have
the unshakeable faith

08:21.699 --> 08:23.772
but you shouldn't be here.

08:24.473 --> 08:26.335
This will not be pleasant.

08:27.971 --> 08:29.943
Such is life, sir.

08:57.205 --> 08:59.907
My father used to say,

09:00.641 --> 09:02.740
"how you do anything

09:02.741 --> 09:05.880
"is how you do everything."

09:05.881 --> 09:09.213
Called it the first
and the last rule of life.

09:12.815 --> 09:14.482
You believe in rules...

09:17.888 --> 09:19.190
Mr. Manager?

09:21.297 --> 09:22.325
Oh, I do.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.966
And what of consequences?

09:27.732 --> 09:28.969
Of course.

09:31.067 --> 09:33.474
And second chances.

09:33.475 --> 09:37.310
Ah. That's where we differ,

09:37.311 --> 09:38.444
you and I.

09:42.011 --> 09:43.814
Second chances

09:43.815 --> 09:47.119
are the refuge of men who fail.

10:17.388 --> 10:18.821
Mm.

10:19.821 --> 10:22.253
There are those on the table

10:23.053 --> 10:24.788
who blame this, um,

10:24.789 --> 10:27.390
atrocity on New York.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.998
They believe it's this city.

10:33.263 --> 10:35.602
The table has indulged this

10:35.603 --> 10:37.235
fucking place for too long.

10:38.402 --> 10:40.304
And look where
that has gotten us.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.546
I shot him.

10:45.547 --> 10:47.916
And yet he lives,

10:48.883 --> 10:50.577
polluting everything he touches.

10:50.578 --> 10:53.420
Marquis,
respectfully,

10:53.421 --> 10:55.055
Your hotel?

10:57.086 --> 10:59.994
If I might, sir?

11:07.899 --> 11:09.168
By all means.

11:12.173 --> 11:15.075
The continentals
and their management

11:15.808 --> 11:17.844
are a reminder

11:17.845 --> 11:19.814
to all who sit beneath the table

11:19.815 --> 11:23.182
that none of us
are above the rules.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.384
And yet we are here.

11:28.084 --> 11:29.384
Sir, Mr. Wick...

11:29.385 --> 11:31.927
We're not here
because of John wick!

11:36.364 --> 11:39.561
He is simply the face
of your failure, Mr. Manager.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.204
The sand in that glass

11:46.205 --> 11:50.407
is merely an echo
of my remaining Patience.

12:20.271 --> 12:22.340
You are no longer New York.

12:25.677 --> 12:27.114
You are nothing.

12:29.652 --> 12:31.580
You are excommunicado.

12:33.688 --> 12:34.715
And as such...

12:37.591 --> 12:40.655
You no longer need
the services

13:06.953 --> 13:09.585
It has been an honor,

13:10.724 --> 13:12.087
my friend.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.302
It should have been me.

13:25.442 --> 13:26.470
Yes.

13:27.675 --> 13:28.769
But it wasn't.

13:29.879 --> 13:31.610
Now, you think about
why that is,

13:31.611 --> 13:35.281
and perhaps one of us
will have benefited

15:09.372 --> 15:10.772
I have a name for you.

15:11.715 --> 15:13.115
Respectfully,

15:13.947 --> 15:15.216
I'm retired.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.350
Finished. Done.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.353
I disagree.

15:21.352 --> 15:22.817
I'm no use to you.

15:24.727 --> 15:26.160
Or the table.

15:26.161 --> 15:29.630
That's not for you to decide.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.634
I think you should
find someone else.

15:42.371 --> 15:43.673
You came close.

15:45.141 --> 15:46.379
Today.

15:47.045 --> 15:48.408
Too close.

15:48.409 --> 15:50.350
You put her in danger.

16:03.294 --> 16:04.727
I know the deal I made.

16:16.606 --> 16:19.247
A former associate, I believe.

16:23.212 --> 16:24.483
He was.

16:28.186 --> 16:29.422
And a friend.

16:32.595 --> 16:33.595
Hmm.

16:36.398 --> 16:39.267
The agreement
with the table

16:40.397 --> 16:42.164
We give you a name,

16:42.165 --> 16:43.502
you give us a life.

16:43.970 --> 16:44.970
Or...

16:46.204 --> 16:47.440
We take one.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.627
I will serve.

17:10.528 --> 17:12.465
I will be of service.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.404
Excellent!

17:22.040 --> 17:24.741
I assume you
have a notion of

17:28.245 --> 17:31.616
John wick has
few friends remaining

17:32.284 --> 17:34.421
and even fewer he trusts

17:35.220 --> 17:36.456
with his life.

17:40.656 --> 17:42.295
Very, very good.

18:32.143 --> 18:35.444
Welcome to
the Osaka continental.

18:35.445 --> 18:36.879
Yeah, I'm lookin' for a room.

18:40.852 --> 18:43.490
I'm afraid this facility
doesn't allow animals.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.822
Emotional support animal.

18:46.823 --> 18:48.755
She's your
support animal?

18:48.756 --> 18:51.729
I'm hers.
Isn't that right?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.538
She stays in your room.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.774
Enjoy your stay, sir.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.719
It's not too bad.

19:15.584 --> 19:17.156
Not bad at all.

19:31.673 --> 19:33.765
There is a dog in my lobby.

19:33.766 --> 19:35.369
Emotional support animal.

19:35.370 --> 19:37.442
Of course it is.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.942
Tomorrow's schedule.
Mr. Suzuki at 11:00

19:39.943 --> 19:42.542
and the tarasovs
are requesting

19:42.543 --> 19:44.448
What's this at 8:00?

19:44.449 --> 19:45.747
Dinner with your daughter.

19:45.748 --> 19:46.919
She says
she's concerned

19:46.920 --> 19:48.456
working too hard.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.420
What must I have done to deserve

19:51.421 --> 19:53.888
such a considerate child?

19:53.889 --> 19:57.227
Good Karma,
I suppose. Indeed.

19:57.228 --> 19:59.830
And how are our guests?

19:59.831 --> 20:03.333
Some of
our gold club members

20:03.334 --> 20:05.370
It's always something.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.336
And today it's New York.

20:07.337 --> 20:08.842
And my concierge?

20:08.843 --> 20:10.844
Concerned.

20:10.845 --> 20:14.416
Perhaps we should
get you an emotional

20:21.048 --> 20:23.252
We've done nothing
to offend the table.

20:23.253 --> 20:25.150
Your relationship with Mr. Wick
is no secret.

20:25.151 --> 20:28.188
The table will come.

20:28.189 --> 20:30.157
And...

20:31.400 --> 20:34.167
will be met with our grace.

20:34.168 --> 20:35.800
Everything he touches dies.

20:45.279 --> 20:46.679
Forgive me, father.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.487
Akira.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.488
Please tell my daughter

20:57.489 --> 20:59.527
that I look forward
to our dinner.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.626
Apparently not.

22:06.894 --> 22:09.663
Killing the elder
was a mistake, my friend.

22:12.828 --> 22:17.165
Their response
was the destruction of

22:18.969 --> 22:21.136
My daughter fears we are next.

22:22.439 --> 22:23.707
Winston?

22:23.708 --> 22:27.307
Alive, but they executed
his concierge

22:28.448 --> 22:30.079
to prove a point.

22:42.531 --> 22:44.599
Have you given any thought to

22:45.134 --> 22:46.667
where this ends?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.037
The table will never stop.

22:56.079 --> 22:57.079
You know this.

23:01.217 --> 23:02.980
It only takes life

23:03.912 --> 23:05.950
and only gives death.

23:12.192 --> 23:13.221
Koji...

23:23.134 --> 23:26.333
Friendship means little
when it's convenient.

24:16.993 --> 24:19.158
Welcome to
the Osaka continental.

24:19.159 --> 24:20.321
The manager.

24:22.891 --> 24:24.127
<i>Por favor.</i>

24:27.367 --> 24:29.294
Of course.

24:29.295 --> 24:31.002
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

24:41.584 --> 24:44.785
The only path
this leads to is death.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.284
I'm going to kill them all.

24:50.285 --> 24:53.156
I believe you'll try.

24:53.691 --> 24:55.188
But no one,

24:55.189 --> 24:57.996
not even you, can kill everyone.

25:00.764 --> 25:02.000
You want to die?

25:02.866 --> 25:04.167
That's your choice.

25:05.736 --> 25:06.939
A good death

25:07.939 --> 25:10.305
only comes after a good life.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.808
You and I left
a good life behind

25:13.809 --> 25:16.113
a long time ago, my friend.

25:21.324 --> 25:23.087
Father, the high table.

25:24.855 --> 25:26.184
What is he doing here?

25:26.185 --> 25:28.323
Mr. Wick
is our guest.

25:29.330 --> 25:30.722
Father...

25:30.723 --> 25:33.160
I'll talk to them.
They don't know

25:33.161 --> 25:35.968
Stay with Mr. Wick.

25:48.549 --> 25:49.751
<i>Hai.</i>

26:15.344 --> 26:18.307
Welcome
to the Osaka continental, gentlemen.

26:19.241 --> 26:22.242
How may I be of service?

26:22.243 --> 26:23.947
The table has reason to believe

26:23.948 --> 26:27.320
that this facility
is providing services...

26:31.892 --> 26:34.893
That is a grave accusation.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.799
We will require
full access

26:39.400 --> 26:40.862
Of course.

26:40.863 --> 26:42.565
But as you are well aware,

26:42.566 --> 26:44.396
no business,

26:44.397 --> 26:46.101
not even your kind of business,

26:46.102 --> 26:49.709
may be conducted
on continental grounds.

26:49.710 --> 26:52.237
So, I'm going to have to ask you

26:52.238 --> 26:54.849
to surrender your firearms.

26:56.617 --> 26:58.716
We speak for the Marquis.

26:58.717 --> 27:00.855
And I speak for Osaka.

27:01.455 --> 27:02.483
Your guns,

27:03.192 --> 27:04.287
please.

27:06.193 --> 27:10.059
Don't repeat the mistake
that fool in New York made.

27:10.060 --> 27:13.091
Fools talk, cowards are silent,

27:13.092 --> 27:15.900
but wise men listen.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.872
So which one will you be?

27:28.418 --> 27:30.610
Hello, old friend.

27:33.349 --> 27:37.221
So good of you to visit
after all these years.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.488
You are
with them now?

27:43.027 --> 27:45.097
No.
Your daughter?

27:45.861 --> 27:47.099
Mia?

27:48.700 --> 27:49.904
Alive.

27:51.573 --> 27:52.973
And your daughter Akira?

27:54.904 --> 27:56.108
Well.

27:57.841 --> 27:59.045
I'm glad.

28:01.648 --> 28:02.884
You know...

28:04.853 --> 28:06.987
We don't have
to end this with blood.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.621
Then leave.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.089
No one defies the table.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.692
I remember once
you understood that.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.260
And I remember a time

28:16.261 --> 28:19.165
when you understood
the meaning of brotherhood.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.832
Enough!

28:20.833 --> 28:22.835
By order of
the Marquis de gramont,

28:22.836 --> 28:25.335
this hotel has
been deconsecrated.

28:26.376 --> 28:27.601
Step aside.

28:43.691 --> 28:45.124
Don't do this, koji.

28:54.931 --> 28:56.234
I'm sorry.

30:15.717 --> 30:16.776
Get out.

30:41.272 --> 30:42.904
Secure the hotel.

30:42.905 --> 30:44.243
Find wick.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.711
If they find you here,

30:53.712 --> 30:56.684
the table will
kill my father, me,

30:57.852 --> 31:00.292
everyone, because
you broke the rules.

31:01.862 --> 31:03.295
You shouldn't have come.

31:27.787 --> 31:28.787
You armed?

32:39.523 --> 32:40.755
<i>Hai.</i>

33:35.177 --> 33:36.848
Hey!

33:36.849 --> 33:38.445
Blind man!

33:38.446 --> 33:40.518
Do your job!

37:53.602 --> 37:54.937
Akira!

38:13.624 --> 38:14.987
Get out the way you came.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.460
Go to
the umeda station.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.995
Don't insult my gift to you.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.737
And, John, do me
a small courtesy.

43:48.362 --> 43:49.390
John?

43:50.760 --> 43:51.964
Caine.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.942
They gave you my name.

44:06.380 --> 44:07.441
Yeah.

44:10.714 --> 44:12.083
I'm sorry.

44:14.420 --> 44:15.449
Me, too.

44:37.274 --> 44:39.143
You should have stayed out.

44:40.042 --> 44:42.542
For all our sakes.

44:43.651 --> 44:45.479
I tried.

44:47.453 --> 44:48.548
Did you?

45:23.084 --> 45:24.419
Come on, John.

45:27.190 --> 45:28.559
Let's get this shit over with.

45:32.566 --> 45:34.098
Yeah.

45:34.099 --> 45:36.398
That sounds like a good idea.

45:52.982 --> 45:54.482
You took a deal.

45:56.756 --> 45:58.156
Same as you, John.

46:01.857 --> 46:03.062
Family?

46:06.727 --> 46:07.961
Family.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.592
You dead, John?

47:15.932 --> 47:17.169
John.

47:17.868 --> 47:19.237
Caine.

47:57.339 --> 48:01.342
John wick, open...

48:01.343 --> 48:05.744
John wick...

49:11.045 --> 49:12.910
Damn, Johnny.

49:12.911 --> 49:15.419
This is
quite the mess

49:16.020 --> 49:17.787
I don't know you.

49:17.788 --> 49:18.921
But I know you.

49:26.767 --> 49:28.333
You a tracker?

49:33.971 --> 49:35.241
How much?

49:38.405 --> 49:39.773
Not enough.

49:42.542 --> 49:43.744
But it's gettin' there.

49:49.756 --> 49:52.192
I need you
to take better care

49:54.459 --> 49:56.394
'Cause we're
in this together now.

50:40.938 --> 50:42.407
All right, koji.

50:46.612 --> 50:49.546
Just tell me where John is
and get out of here.

50:50.949 --> 50:52.010
Leave.

50:53.118 --> 50:55.684
Go somewhere far away.

50:57.452 --> 50:58.984
You know I won't.

51:28.283 --> 51:30.048
You owe John wick nothing.

51:33.092 --> 51:35.427
He has no marker on you.

51:41.468 --> 51:44.529
You must
have fallen far

51:44.530 --> 51:46.531
the only debts we have...

51:48.137 --> 51:50.002
lie in markers.

51:56.651 --> 51:57.746
Come on.

52:00.185 --> 52:01.816
I don't want to do this.

52:48.029 --> 52:49.369
Father!

53:05.018 --> 53:06.111
Look at me.

53:14.460 --> 53:16.858
Even a blind man knows
you have lost.

53:19.098 --> 53:20.532
And, caine,

53:22.097 --> 53:25.801
you don't need eyes
to see the right path.

53:29.476 --> 53:31.136
Just take care of your daughter.

53:33.506 --> 53:34.843
I...

53:37.915 --> 53:39.012
I am.

53:45.684 --> 53:47.625
No!

54:24.559 --> 54:25.894
Don't.

54:28.463 --> 54:29.667
Live.

54:51.719 --> 54:53.493
I'll be waiting for you.

56:06.198 --> 56:07.325
Who is he?

56:14.405 --> 56:16.070
He was a friend.

56:18.040 --> 56:20.338
My father is dead
because of you.

56:23.745 --> 56:25.277
Because of what you did.

56:28.915 --> 56:31.118
So either you kill him...

56:33.291 --> 56:34.627
Or I will.

56:41.729 --> 56:43.603
I understand.

57:03.718 --> 57:07.055
Goodbye, Mr. Wick.

57:30.217 --> 57:31.376
Thanks for coming.

57:32.884 --> 57:34.585
Well, us homeless folk
do have to

57:34.586 --> 57:36.656
stick together now, don't we?

57:40.922 --> 57:43.729
I need to speak to him.

57:45.632 --> 57:48.059
Last time you spoke to him,

57:48.060 --> 57:51.069
you shot him off a roof.

57:51.070 --> 57:53.031
I had no choice.

57:53.032 --> 57:54.905
They held all the cards.

57:55.372 --> 57:56.676
No.

57:57.476 --> 57:59.209
But who held the gun?

57:59.210 --> 58:01.841
John needs to know
the breadth of what's

58:01.842 --> 58:03.681
This Marquis is unrestrained.

58:03.682 --> 58:05.645
The table have
let him off the leash.

58:05.646 --> 58:07.880
Oh, my dear Winston,

58:07.881 --> 58:10.822
your benevolence is touching!

58:11.922 --> 58:14.624
But tell me.
Tell me true.

58:14.625 --> 58:17.323
Why did the frenchman
let you live?

58:17.324 --> 58:20.293
Killing a man
can turn him

58:21.434 --> 58:24.032
Letting him live...

58:24.033 --> 58:27.366
Tells the world
he's a coward

58:30.937 --> 58:32.745
So what are you?

58:34.709 --> 58:36.243
Aggrieved.

58:58.001 --> 59:01.399
I fail to see
how laying waste

59:01.400 --> 59:04.909
is getting you closer
to killing John wick.

59:04.910 --> 59:08.206
This campaign
is not to kill John wick.

59:08.207 --> 59:11.146
It is to kill
the idea

59:12.045 --> 59:13.980
And to do that, I must

59:13.981 --> 59:16.855
destroy everything
that idea touches.

59:21.925 --> 59:23.855
The bloodshed in Osaka

59:23.856 --> 59:25.391
was not necessary.

59:26.964 --> 59:30.033
The bloodshed was the point.

59:45.849 --> 59:47.787
He'll make it your choice.

59:55.561 --> 59:57.423
You, come with me.

59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.196
Think twice before accepting.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:08.973
And you are?

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:10.975
Nobody.

01:00:13.006 --> 01:00:16.743
Coyness, Mr. Nobody,

01:00:16.744 --> 01:00:18.444
is a pathetic trait.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.411
A miscalculation,

01:00:21.412 --> 01:00:24.819
in which by trying
to hide our ego,

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.859
we let it appear stark naked.

01:00:29.729 --> 01:00:31.523
I will ask only once.

01:00:36.769 --> 01:00:38.970
How were you able to locate him?

01:00:41.103 --> 01:00:42.534
Pay and I'll tell you.

01:00:48.609 --> 01:00:51.681
How much would
such a service

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:53.146
Twenty-five million,

01:00:53.147 --> 01:00:56.012
plus a matching contribution
to my 401k

01:00:56.013 --> 01:00:57.286
when he's dead.

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:58.451
Hmm.

01:01:00.922 --> 01:01:02.691
We found him once.

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:03.756
We'll find him again.

01:01:03.757 --> 01:01:05.092
Is that before

01:01:05.093 --> 01:01:07.262
or after he puts you
in the ground?

01:01:14.342 --> 01:01:15.402
I like you.

01:01:19.039 --> 01:01:20.506
Twenty million.

01:01:24.584 --> 01:01:25.984
Like me some more.

01:01:27.388 --> 01:01:28.481
Twenty-three.

01:01:29.557 --> 01:01:32.750
Ego, Mr. Nobody. Mm.

01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:34.857
It's 23.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.621
You clearly can afford it.

01:01:44.836 --> 01:01:46.532
For the service.
Mm-hmm.

01:01:49.968 --> 01:01:51.669
Fuck!

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.612
No, no, no.
No. It's okay.

01:01:55.613 --> 01:01:57.715
Hey, it's okay.
Sit. Sit.

01:02:01.048 --> 01:02:03.013
What the fuck is this, man?

01:02:03.014 --> 01:02:05.283
A choice.

01:02:05.284 --> 01:02:06.856
You can pull the knife out

01:02:06.857 --> 01:02:10.027
or you can pull your hand out.

01:02:10.028 --> 01:02:12.957
One shows me
a man committed

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:14.357
and the other,

01:02:14.358 --> 01:02:16.694
a man committed to the cause.

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.136
Which one are you?

01:03:54.093 --> 01:03:55.364
Winston.

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.399
Jonathan.

01:03:59.133 --> 01:04:01.073
My condolences.

01:04:02.335 --> 01:04:04.109
He was a good man.

01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:07.541
Yes, he was.

01:04:08.308 --> 01:04:10.247
Taken for our sins.

01:04:20.253 --> 01:04:21.720
Who is this?

01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:25.393
The Marquis de gramont.

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:29.092
Elevated only by
his guarantee

01:04:29.093 --> 01:04:32.566
All the resources
of the table

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.635
Where do I find him?

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:37.736
Paris.

01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:44.116
Where will it end?

01:04:45.683 --> 01:04:46.683
Huh?

01:04:48.116 --> 01:04:49.517
With him dead.

01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:52.355
Oh. And then?

01:04:53.921 --> 01:04:55.253
Hmm?

01:04:55.254 --> 01:04:59.558
Have you learned nothing?

01:04:59.559 --> 01:05:03.062
They will replace him
before the body's cold.

01:05:03.063 --> 01:05:04.895
Hercules had his hydra.

01:05:04.896 --> 01:05:07.365
You have the table,
except you'll

01:05:07.366 --> 01:05:09.438
before they run out of heads.

01:05:13.674 --> 01:05:17.212
Kill him, but do it
the smart way.

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.349
And get him to give you
your freedom.

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.384
How?

01:05:23.385 --> 01:05:26.023
Turn his rules
and consequences

01:05:26.024 --> 01:05:28.556
Challenge him to single combat.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:33.497
High table duels are a myth.

01:05:33.498 --> 01:05:34.932
Wrong!

01:05:34.933 --> 01:05:37.727
They're a cold hard fact,

01:05:37.728 --> 01:05:39.963
and part of the foundation
of the table

01:05:39.964 --> 01:05:43.571
to stop its more
combustible members

01:05:45.944 --> 01:05:48.345
It's also, win or lose,

01:05:50.476 --> 01:05:52.382
what you say you want,

01:05:53.048 --> 01:05:54.582
a way out.

01:05:58.551 --> 01:06:00.955
I don't sit at the table.

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:03.357
Your family does.

01:06:03.358 --> 01:06:05.160
Get them to issue the challenge

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:07.732
and then offer you up as proxy.

01:06:07.733 --> 01:06:10.066
I don't have a family.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:12.633
The ruska roma tore my ticket.

01:06:14.307 --> 01:06:18.243
Then I suggest
you get your ass

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.443
and get it mended.

01:06:21.142 --> 01:06:22.346
Or...

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:25.877
Pick a plot.

01:06:28.486 --> 01:06:30.882
What do you get
out of this, Winston?

01:06:32.259 --> 01:06:34.523
What you were so good
at getting, Jonathan.

01:06:35.287 --> 01:06:37.324
Revenge.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.581
Hmm.

01:08:16.294 --> 01:08:17.725
Nice suit.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.674
Speak.

01:08:35.675 --> 01:08:38.580
He's in Berlin,
at the ruska roma.

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.980
<i>You can wire
that finder's fee now.</i>

01:08:40.981 --> 01:08:42.046
No.

01:08:42.856 --> 01:08:44.354
<i>Excuse me?</i>

01:08:44.355 --> 01:08:46.853
Kill John and you'll
get your money.

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:50.087
That wasn't part of our deal.

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:54.960
The deal was for your service.

01:08:54.961 --> 01:08:58.634
And it's now
a life for a life,

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:03.968
<i>Yours or his.</i>

01:09:03.969 --> 01:09:07.537
When it's done,
you will have your prize.

01:09:07.538 --> 01:09:08.974
And your pension.

01:09:18.285 --> 01:09:19.523
Asshole.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.754
Jonathan wick?

01:10:10.174 --> 01:10:11.603
You are forgetting

01:10:11.604 --> 01:10:14.607
we are still under the table.

01:10:14.608 --> 01:10:17.310
And last I checked...

01:10:17.311 --> 01:10:19.511
you are excommunicado

01:10:19.512 --> 01:10:22.718
and your ticket was torn.

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:27.459
You have no business with us.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:31.925
Pyotr is dead!

01:10:36.837 --> 01:10:38.466
After you

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.670
put a bullet
in the elder's head,

01:10:42.509 --> 01:10:45.004
the Marquis had one
put in pyotr's.

01:10:46.105 --> 01:10:49.511
And in fine Russian tradition...

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:52.209
He sent us the bill.

01:10:53.954 --> 01:10:55.512
Because of you,

01:10:55.513 --> 01:10:56.981
I had to kneel

01:10:56.982 --> 01:10:59.916
in front of the man
who murdered my father.

01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:02.156
Then we have

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:03.825
a common enemy.

01:11:05.197 --> 01:11:08.093
We can help each other.

01:11:08.094 --> 01:11:12.295
You can't even help yourself.

01:11:12.296 --> 01:11:14.730
How the hell
are you going

01:11:14.731 --> 01:11:18.636
By killing this Marquis.

01:11:18.637 --> 01:11:20.538
They just appoint another.

01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:26.643
It does

01:11:26.644 --> 01:11:29.653
if I kill him in a duel!

01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:12.556
How many did you kill

01:12:12.557 --> 01:12:13.723
to get out?

01:12:13.724 --> 01:12:15.864
A lot.

01:12:16.964 --> 01:12:18.999
You will only have to kill one

01:12:19.567 --> 01:12:20.867
to get back in.

01:12:20.868 --> 01:12:23.971
The bastard who
murdered my father.

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:28.140
Give me the name.

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:31.041
Killa harkan.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:33.648
You will find him
at himmel and hölle.

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:36.485
When he's dead,
I will mend your ticket.

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:38.815
And the crest?

01:12:38.816 --> 01:12:41.725
Harkan first, then we talk.

01:12:42.393 --> 01:12:44.092
Bring proof of death.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.029
I'll need a way in.

01:12:51.635 --> 01:12:53.231
I know a way.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:55.673
Klaus will take you.

01:13:04.985 --> 01:13:06.277
I am Klaus.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.018
John.
I am Klaus.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.034
Please tell your mistress

01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:05.006
that I am honored
by this gesture

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:08.009
and I look forward to
our continuing partnership.

01:14:09.413 --> 01:14:10.715
I am Klaus.

01:14:17.685 --> 01:14:20.219
Mr. John wick

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.291
in the flesh.

01:14:23.821 --> 01:14:27.127
The baba yaga.

01:14:28.368 --> 01:14:29.659
Must be Christmas, <i>ja?</i>

01:14:40.974 --> 01:14:42.879
Where are
my manners? Please.

01:14:48.816 --> 01:14:50.953
A drink, Mr. Wick?

01:14:54.153 --> 01:14:56.157
You were expecting me.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.322
Not me.

01:14:58.493 --> 01:14:59.698
Him.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.561
John?

01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:05.270
How are you?

01:15:07.307 --> 01:15:09.238
You knew I'd be here.

01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:11.006
I suspected it.

01:15:11.704 --> 01:15:12.942
Family.

01:15:17.717 --> 01:15:20.884
That family
sold you out, Mr. Wick.

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:23.885
They gave you up

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:26.351
in the vain hope
of saving themselves.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.821
You see, that's why
I never trust the cossacks.

01:15:29.822 --> 01:15:32.559
They are dirty people.

01:15:35.863 --> 01:15:37.934
This is personal.

01:15:40.439 --> 01:15:42.136
I sense tension here.

01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:46.006
Mr. Wick may
probably feel

01:15:46.007 --> 01:15:48.747
I'm responsible
for the death of a...

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:50.980
Mutual friend.

01:15:54.247 --> 01:15:57.316
But I didn't kill koji.
You did, John.

01:15:59.653 --> 01:16:02.522
You know,
this discord

01:16:02.523 --> 01:16:03.960
it saddens me.

01:16:05.365 --> 01:16:06.365
Allow me to help.

01:16:09.268 --> 01:16:10.296
<i>Nein.</i>

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:12.936
We have a deal.

01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:16.899
Had.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.435
The Marquis.

01:16:18.436 --> 01:16:20.575
Hell, I doubt he'll
mind if it's bullets,

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:22.410
blades or a blind man.

01:16:43.233 --> 01:16:46.035
Is this for me, Mr...

01:16:47.338 --> 01:16:48.338
Nobody.

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:52.305
And, no, it's actually for him.

01:16:57.147 --> 01:17:00.282
Then take
a seat,

01:17:04.217 --> 01:17:06.022
Exciting, <i>ja?</i>

01:17:15.766 --> 01:17:19.134
So, you want to kill him.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:23.105
You want to kill him.

01:17:24.477 --> 01:17:26.009
I want to kill him.

01:17:27.108 --> 01:17:28.913
What about
you, Mr. Wick?

01:17:29.581 --> 01:17:31.580
I'm going to kill you.

01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:32.912
Oh.

01:17:32.913 --> 01:17:35.381
For pyotr. Of course, <i>ja.</i>

01:17:36.923 --> 01:17:39.886
But it looks like
we have ourselves, uh,

01:17:39.887 --> 01:17:42.859
a genuine conundrum.

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:46.363
A quandary, if you will.
A real-life dilemma.

01:17:48.025 --> 01:17:49.362
So...

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:53.303
How about we play a game?

01:17:53.304 --> 01:17:54.433
One hand.

01:17:55.301 --> 01:17:57.469
The winner decides who lives...

01:17:59.512 --> 01:18:00.972
And who does not.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:09.013
All right.
What's the buy-in?

01:18:09.014 --> 01:18:11.315
More than you can afford.

01:18:11.316 --> 01:18:13.183
Yeah, I'm one bullet away

01:18:13.184 --> 01:18:15.388
from being a very rich man.

01:18:16.924 --> 01:18:18.292
Or a dead one.

01:18:20.565 --> 01:18:23.330
Five-card draw.

01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:48.487
Mr. Wick.

01:18:49.627 --> 01:18:50.929
Mr. Wick?

01:19:14.214 --> 01:19:16.317
Dead man's hand, Mr. Wick.

01:19:20.326 --> 01:19:21.326
Well...

01:19:22.693 --> 01:19:24.292
I don't gamble.

01:19:26.927 --> 01:19:28.131
Let's see.

01:19:35.674 --> 01:19:37.938
Four nines. And a four.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.440
Most impressive.

01:19:52.284 --> 01:19:55.724
Ah. Royal flush.

01:19:55.725 --> 01:19:57.526
Pretty good for a nobody.

01:19:57.527 --> 01:19:58.689
Thank you.

01:20:00.734 --> 01:20:03.964
A blind man, a guy with a dog

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.999
and John wick walk into a bar

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.467
and take a seat at the table.

01:20:09.468 --> 01:20:11.607
That either sounds
like the beginning

01:20:11.608 --> 01:20:13.172
of a stupendous joke

01:20:13.173 --> 01:20:15.842
or a most
profitable opportunity.

01:20:17.982 --> 01:20:22.185
One thinks he can
serve his way out.

01:20:26.591 --> 01:20:27.751
One...

01:20:29.026 --> 01:20:31.326
Thinks he can buy his way out.

01:20:34.159 --> 01:20:35.594
And one...

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.564
Thinks he can kill

01:20:39.638 --> 01:20:40.764
his way out.

01:20:43.509 --> 01:20:46.704
Each of them all think
that they have

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:49.443
But what they fail

01:20:50.483 --> 01:20:51.940
to realize

01:20:51.941 --> 01:20:55.680
is that the moment they took
a seat at the table...

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:01.021
They had already lost.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:03.523
Let me guess.
Five of a kind?

01:21:05.159 --> 01:21:06.255
Yeah.

01:21:13.706 --> 01:21:15.205
Just so you know,

01:21:16.467 --> 01:21:18.538
pyotr wasn't personal.

01:21:20.339 --> 01:21:21.541
Now, maybe a little bit.

01:21:25.144 --> 01:21:27.984
Kill!

01:22:46.692 --> 01:22:48.628
Hey!
He's over there!

01:25:43.768 --> 01:25:45.871
Nuts!

01:26:14.439 --> 01:26:16.605
Know what
your problem is,

01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:19.674
You are unlucky.

01:26:21.144 --> 01:26:22.644
Unlucky in life,

01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:24.506
in love,

01:26:24.507 --> 01:26:26.384
in friendship...

01:26:28.579 --> 01:26:29.849
And now...

01:26:31.384 --> 01:26:32.854
In death.

01:27:32.349 --> 01:27:34.584
Killa!

01:28:23.432 --> 01:28:26.130
Why don't you just die?

01:29:33.765 --> 01:29:35.001
He's mine.

01:29:37.101 --> 01:29:39.139
I told you not to take a deal.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.579
Yeah, I guess
your deal didn't

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:44.177
Huh?

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:46.716
Hell of a thing
for them to take

01:29:51.388 --> 01:29:52.623
They didn't take them.

01:29:54.786 --> 01:29:55.989
I gave them.

01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:34.717
The ruska roma will support

01:31:34.718 --> 01:31:35.990
your challenge.

01:31:37.221 --> 01:31:38.795
Who will be your second?

01:32:07.286 --> 01:32:10.123
A warning
of the cost of tyranny.

01:32:13.557 --> 01:32:16.892
You must intend
to join your concierge.

01:32:16.893 --> 01:32:18.230
Not today.

01:32:25.369 --> 01:32:27.475
Per the old ways
and the old laws,

01:32:27.476 --> 01:32:30.274
John wick calls you to a duel.

01:32:30.275 --> 01:32:32.908
To settle your differences
the old-fashioned way,

01:32:32.909 --> 01:32:34.917
as gentlemen should.

01:32:37.153 --> 01:32:39.515
You speak of the old ways
as if you know them.

01:32:40.692 --> 01:32:42.757
A man of Mr. Wick's
station

01:32:42.758 --> 01:32:44.520
cannot issue such a challenge.

01:32:46.157 --> 01:32:48.293
He has his family's crest.

01:32:50.962 --> 01:32:52.297
Hmm.

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:54.303
Berlin.

01:32:54.304 --> 01:32:55.763
Ruska roma challenge,

01:32:55.764 --> 01:32:57.767
the acceptance
of Mr. Wick

01:32:57.768 --> 01:32:59.506
it's all there.

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:01.240
Recorded history now.

01:33:09.786 --> 01:33:11.485
And why would I accept this

01:33:11.486 --> 01:33:13.121
from a second-rate seat?

01:33:13.122 --> 01:33:15.450
Because there
are rules,

01:33:15.451 --> 01:33:18.488
We live with
the animals. Exactly.

01:33:19.958 --> 01:33:21.161
Mm.

01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.526
Times are changing.

01:33:24.436 --> 01:33:25.863
A new day is dawning.

01:33:25.864 --> 01:33:28.806
New ideas, new rules,

01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:31.039
new management.

01:33:33.104 --> 01:33:35.238
Yet you will accept.

01:33:35.239 --> 01:33:39.245
Because we all still sit
beneath the table.

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:42.545
Even you are not immune
to the consequences of failure.

01:33:50.423 --> 01:33:53.490
And what exactly
are Mr. Wick's terms?

01:33:54.333 --> 01:33:56.892
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

01:33:56.893 --> 01:34:01.872
The unconditional release
of any and all obligations

01:34:16.216 --> 01:34:19.120
Ah, history is littered
with Marquis

01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:21.551
who were
only remembered

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.421
But you...

01:34:25.323 --> 01:34:26.762
You could be remembered

01:34:26.763 --> 01:34:29.191
as the man who brought
John wick,

01:34:29.192 --> 01:34:30.925
the most feared of all

01:34:30.926 --> 01:34:33.530
by the table
and all who sit at it,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.368
Your light.

01:34:38.609 --> 01:34:40.104
And who could predict

01:34:40.105 --> 01:34:42.204
how high that kind of glory

01:34:42.205 --> 01:34:44.607
could take a man in our world?

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:05.232
Noon, <i>la tour eiffel,</i>
to discuss rules.

01:35:06.097 --> 01:35:07.366
You may go.

01:35:08.539 --> 01:35:09.599
When I'm done.

01:35:11.041 --> 01:35:12.703
As his second, upon his victory,

01:35:12.704 --> 01:35:16.439
my excommunicado
is to be lifted,

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.440
my hotel rebuilt
and re-consecrated,

01:35:19.441 --> 01:35:21.512
all at the table's expense.

01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:25.054
Of course.

01:35:35.297 --> 01:35:38.001
How you do anything
is how you do everything.

01:35:39.933 --> 01:35:41.136
Now I'm done.

01:35:45.241 --> 01:35:47.170
I think I'll miss you
when you're gone.

01:35:47.171 --> 01:35:49.243
Shame I can't say the same.

01:35:50.143 --> 01:35:51.674
You don't know, do you?

01:35:52.781 --> 01:35:54.982
What's that?

01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:58.150
A man's second,
like his sponsor,

01:35:58.151 --> 01:36:00.247
either walks out
with his champion

01:36:00.248 --> 01:36:02.223
or is buried beside him.

01:36:03.792 --> 01:36:05.325
The old ways.

01:36:13.571 --> 01:36:14.631
Such is life.

01:37:01.985 --> 01:37:04.147
Under the old laws,

01:37:04.148 --> 01:37:06.414
only one can survive.

01:37:06.415 --> 01:37:08.223
Do you both understand that?

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.395
Very good.

01:37:13.396 --> 01:37:15.260
Rules.

01:37:15.261 --> 01:37:18.167
The challenged
chooses first. Time?

01:37:19.998 --> 01:37:21.269
Sunrise.

01:37:26.906 --> 01:37:28.144
Now.

01:37:31.914 --> 01:37:33.248
Sunrise.

01:37:33.749 --> 01:37:34.749
Location?

01:37:35.884 --> 01:37:37.649
You come here

01:37:37.650 --> 01:37:40.189
thinking there is
a way out of this world

01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:43.489
There is not.

01:37:46.357 --> 01:37:48.230
Le centre Pompidou.

01:37:50.932 --> 01:37:52.531
Sacré coeur.

01:37:57.235 --> 01:37:58.504
Sacré coeur.

01:37:59.708 --> 01:38:00.708
Weapons?

01:38:01.778 --> 01:38:03.142
If you win,

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.214
the table will honor its word.

01:38:06.314 --> 01:38:07.678
You will have your freedom.

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:10.516
But you won't take it.

01:38:11.786 --> 01:38:12.786
Blades.

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.097
Pistols.

01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:29.204
Dueling pistols.
Thirty paces.

01:38:29.205 --> 01:38:31.670
In the event that
both parties survive,

01:38:31.671 --> 01:38:35.138
each will approach the other
at increments of ten paces

01:38:35.139 --> 01:38:37.576
until only one remains.

01:38:39.014 --> 01:38:40.414
Rules of engagement.

01:38:41.686 --> 01:38:43.144
No quarter.

01:38:43.145 --> 01:38:45.782
You know why
you won't take

01:38:46.656 --> 01:38:47.685
Hmm?

01:38:49.191 --> 01:38:51.293
Because this is who you are,

01:38:52.194 --> 01:38:53.724
who you've always been.

01:38:55.998 --> 01:38:57.827
You are a killer.

01:39:00.172 --> 01:39:02.803
An orphan we plucked
from the street

01:39:02.804 --> 01:39:05.338
and honed into a knife.

01:39:05.339 --> 01:39:08.244
And it is the killing
that gives you purpose.

01:39:09.244 --> 01:39:11.181
A man without purpose...

01:39:12.981 --> 01:39:14.316
Is nothing.

01:39:16.721 --> 01:39:17.913
No quarter.

01:39:19.549 --> 01:39:21.420
No quarter.

01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:24.355
If there is nothing else, gentlemen,

01:39:24.356 --> 01:39:26.163
I will see...
A nomination.

01:39:30.636 --> 01:39:31.729
It is his right.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.172
Do you have a name?

01:39:40.172 --> 01:39:41.409
Caine.

01:39:43.947 --> 01:39:45.781
So be it.

01:39:45.782 --> 01:39:47.745
Sunrise, sacré coeur.

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:51.712
Dueling pistols, no quarter.

01:39:51.713 --> 01:39:54.256
Should Mr. Wick
be victorious,

01:39:54.257 --> 01:39:56.153
he will be free of any
and all obligation

01:39:56.154 --> 01:39:57.818
to the high table,

01:39:57.819 --> 01:40:00.160
and his second
will be reinstated

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:02.457
as the manager of the rebuilt

01:40:02.458 --> 01:40:04.234
New York continental.

01:40:05.935 --> 01:40:09.969
Should the Marquis
Vincent bisset de gramont

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.736
John wick will be dead.

01:40:14.010 --> 01:40:15.542
As will his second.

01:40:17.409 --> 01:40:19.180
Just so.

01:40:19.181 --> 01:40:20.576
Now, if there is
nothing more, gentlemen,

01:40:20.577 --> 01:40:22.811
I will see you at sunrise.

01:40:22.812 --> 01:40:24.613
Failure to meet
at the appointed hour

01:40:24.614 --> 01:40:26.216
will result in forfeiture

01:40:26.217 --> 01:40:28.456
and immediate execution.

01:40:39.432 --> 01:40:42.503
There is no John out there.

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:46.507
No happy husband
with a normal life.

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:50.742
There's only John wick,

01:40:51.717 --> 01:40:52.810
the killer.

01:40:55.152 --> 01:40:57.287
And he's going to kill you.

01:41:03.961 --> 01:41:05.020
<i>Your hotel?</i>

01:41:06.125 --> 01:41:07.427
Yes.

01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:09.423
You always have
an angle, don't you?

01:41:09.424 --> 01:41:11.430
Doesn't everyone?

01:41:11.431 --> 01:41:15.303
Let's find safe harbor
before it starts.

01:41:15.304 --> 01:41:17.235
There's something
I need to do first.

01:41:17.236 --> 01:41:19.705
Sooner rather than later.

01:41:23.408 --> 01:41:25.078
Won't do it.

01:41:25.079 --> 01:41:26.613
You fight your own fight.

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:32.355
Isn't this what you want?

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:35.550
Hmm?

01:41:35.551 --> 01:41:37.360
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:39.723
You kill him,

01:41:39.724 --> 01:41:41.760
and you and your
daughter will be free.

01:41:43.935 --> 01:41:45.434
No one can touch her.

01:41:46.937 --> 01:41:48.766
If you don't,

01:41:48.767 --> 01:41:51.605
she will have to face
the consequences.

01:41:53.175 --> 01:41:55.312
The choice is yours.

01:43:21.866 --> 01:43:22.927
Caine.

01:43:23.868 --> 01:43:24.995
John.

01:43:26.135 --> 01:43:27.503
Saying goodbyes?

01:43:29.435 --> 01:43:31.067
Saying hello.

01:43:36.347 --> 01:43:38.140
You think your wife
can hear you?

01:43:40.752 --> 01:43:41.847
No.

01:43:45.418 --> 01:43:46.753
Then why bother?

01:43:48.894 --> 01:43:50.427
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:43:54.163 --> 01:43:55.762
The dead are gone.

01:43:59.334 --> 01:44:01.130
Only the living matter.

01:44:06.574 --> 01:44:08.874
After my daughter was born...

01:44:10.776 --> 01:44:12.443
I wanted to leave this life.

01:44:15.016 --> 01:44:16.453
I thought I did.

01:44:18.682 --> 01:44:20.182
But you didn't.

01:44:22.455 --> 01:44:23.889
We're damned...

01:44:26.062 --> 01:44:27.156
You and I.

01:44:28.627 --> 01:44:30.731
On that we agree.

01:44:34.798 --> 01:44:36.605
My daughter's not.

01:44:39.772 --> 01:44:41.841
If it's between you and her...

01:44:44.015 --> 01:44:45.647
You're going to die.

01:44:52.451 --> 01:44:54.018
Maybe not.

01:44:59.229 --> 01:45:00.761
I missed you, John.

01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:05.634
It's so good
to sit with a friend.

01:45:10.603 --> 01:45:12.707
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:45.637
This is how you
resolve the situation?

01:45:45.638 --> 01:45:47.841
Duello with the baba yaga.

01:45:47.842 --> 01:45:51.075
Failure will shake
the foundation

01:45:52.483 --> 01:45:55.717
and it will turn wick
into a Saint.

01:45:58.389 --> 01:46:00.715
My victory will do the opposite.

01:46:03.292 --> 01:46:04.891
Marquis de gramont!

01:46:06.559 --> 01:46:08.724
A man's ambition

01:46:08.725 --> 01:46:11.062
should never exceed his worth.

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:16.969
You would do well
to remember that, sir.

01:47:37.719 --> 01:47:39.719
<i>Bonjour,</i> monsieur wick.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.655
And welcome to <i>la resistance.</i>

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:44.819
A little far from home,
aren't you?

01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:46.253
Well, your little act

01:47:46.254 --> 01:47:48.889
of uncivil disobedience
inspired me, John.

01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:50.561
I'm branching out,

01:47:50.562 --> 01:47:52.864
spreading my wings.

01:47:52.865 --> 01:47:54.935
How goes the grand
farewell tour?

01:47:56.604 --> 01:47:58.136
Coming to an end.

01:47:59.068 --> 01:48:01.403
So it seems. So it seems.

01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:04.681
Forty-two regular, wasn't it?

01:48:05.682 --> 01:48:07.207
It's kevlar, front to back.

01:48:07.208 --> 01:48:09.144
The latest in ballistic chic.

01:48:09.145 --> 01:48:11.015
Appropriate for
all formal occasions.

01:48:11.016 --> 01:48:14.216
Weddings, funerals,
high table duels.

01:48:14.217 --> 01:48:15.952
After all, a man
has to look his best

01:48:15.953 --> 01:48:17.793
when it's time to get married.

01:48:19.328 --> 01:48:20.328
Or buried.

01:48:31.176 --> 01:48:32.236
Forgive me, sir,

01:48:33.003 --> 01:48:34.469
but this is madness.

01:48:35.673 --> 01:48:37.139
Madness?

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.177
Trusting your fate
to a blind man?

01:48:40.477 --> 01:48:43.346
There are three types
of men in this world.

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:48.185
Those who
have something

01:48:48.186 --> 01:48:51.288
those who
have something

01:48:51.289 --> 01:48:54.155
and those who
have something

01:48:54.156 --> 01:48:56.896
John wick has
none of these things.

01:48:56.897 --> 01:49:00.198
He is but a ghost
in search of a graveyard.

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.036
But the blind man,

01:49:04.342 --> 01:49:05.841
well, he has all three.

01:49:07.576 --> 01:49:09.608
Besides, I have a feeling

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.807
Mr. Wick will never make it

01:49:11.808 --> 01:49:13.981
to the duel by sunrise.

01:49:58.824 --> 01:50:00.391
All right, now.

01:50:00.392 --> 01:50:03.196
For all you boppers out there
in the city of lights,

01:50:03.197 --> 01:50:07.161
for all you street people
with an ear for the action,

01:50:07.162 --> 01:50:09.502
<i>to all my loyal listeners</i>

01:50:09.503 --> 01:50:12.504
<i>who know the beat
of the street...</i>

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:17.142
<i>tonight is your chance
to make some beautiful music.</i>

01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:20.679
I've been asked
to relay a special request

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.511
<i>from a secret admirer.</i>

01:50:23.587 --> 01:50:25.216
<i>It seems there's a Thorn</i>

01:50:25.217 --> 01:50:28.754
<i>in our little slice of paradise.</i>

01:50:28.755 --> 01:50:31.025
<i>A wicked man from the big apple</i>

01:50:31.026 --> 01:50:34.457
<i>is making a beeline
to our sacred heart.</i>

01:50:35.633 --> 01:50:37.063
<i>We are putting the call out</i>

01:50:37.064 --> 01:50:41.002
<i>to deliver your hardest beats
to this man in black.</i>

01:50:41.003 --> 01:50:45.406
<i>If you want the prize,
you must finish before sunrise.</i>

01:50:45.407 --> 01:50:47.574
This golden oldie,

01:50:47.575 --> 01:50:50.676
and I do mean golden hit,

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:53.377
goes out to you, Mr. Wick.

01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:58.213
And remember,
there is nowhere to run.

01:52:04.018 --> 01:52:05.278
<i>I want to thank you all</i>

01:52:05.279 --> 01:52:09.518
<i>for listening to wuxia,</i>

01:52:09.519 --> 01:52:12.758
<i>the place for
all your entertainment</i>

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:14.960
<i>and informational needs.</i>

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:16.426
<i>Good hunting.</i>

01:52:18.698 --> 01:52:20.365
And so it begins.

01:52:21.704 --> 01:52:24.006
I'm going to need a gun.

01:52:25.302 --> 01:52:26.976
I thought you'd never ask.

01:52:28.304 --> 01:52:30.742
Nine-millimeter pit viper.

01:52:30.743 --> 01:52:32.508
How'd you get this?

01:52:32.509 --> 01:52:35.677
I know a guy
who knows a guy

01:52:36.821 --> 01:52:38.553
Twenty-one round
capacity magazine

01:52:38.554 --> 01:52:39.620
with a built-in compensator

01:52:39.621 --> 01:52:41.522
for virtually no muzzle flip.

01:52:41.523 --> 01:52:43.491
Fiber-optic front sight,

01:52:43.492 --> 01:52:45.155
ambidextrous safeties,

01:52:45.156 --> 01:52:47.760
flared magwell
for faster reloads,

01:52:47.761 --> 01:52:49.798
two-pound extreme trigger,

01:52:49.799 --> 01:52:52.500
and for those more,
how shall we say,

01:52:52.501 --> 01:52:54.264
intimate encounters,

01:52:54.265 --> 01:52:57.402
this viper has
ferocious fucking fangs.

01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:05.245
How close can you
get me to the church?

01:53:10.421 --> 01:53:11.482
Amen.

01:53:21.559 --> 01:53:24.231
Here we are, gentlemen.

01:53:25.766 --> 01:53:26.865
Your ride.

01:53:30.269 --> 01:53:31.673
When I advised you

01:53:31.674 --> 01:53:33.101
not to dip your pinky

01:53:33.102 --> 01:53:34.941
back into this pond,

01:53:34.942 --> 01:53:37.277
I didn't think I'd get wet.

01:53:40.049 --> 01:53:42.315
It'll all be over after today.

01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:47.452
When I was burying charon,

01:53:49.393 --> 01:53:52.424
I was torn about
what to put

01:53:53.690 --> 01:53:57.059
A few words
to sum up

01:53:57.060 --> 01:54:00.197
Long live the king!

01:54:00.198 --> 01:54:02.269
Had mine made years ago.

01:54:03.638 --> 01:54:04.671
Modest.

01:54:04.672 --> 01:54:06.603
Prophetic.

01:54:07.777 --> 01:54:09.408
What did you decide?

01:54:10.414 --> 01:54:12.243
Friend.

01:54:12.244 --> 01:54:14.743
That's what he was
above all else.

01:54:15.519 --> 01:54:16.646
A friend.

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:28.361
<i>Au revoir
et bonne chasse,</i>

01:54:30.095 --> 01:54:31.496
Thank you, king.

01:54:34.065 --> 01:54:35.335
Jonathan.

01:54:36.473 --> 01:54:37.630
Winston.

01:54:37.631 --> 01:54:40.602
Sunrise is at 6:03.

01:54:40.603 --> 01:54:43.343
Don't be late for
all our sakes, hmm?

01:54:52.888 --> 01:54:54.354
"Loving husband."

01:54:54.788 --> 01:54:56.350
Hmm?

01:54:56.351 --> 01:54:58.725
That's what I want on mine.

01:54:58.726 --> 01:55:01.394
"John. Loving husband."

01:55:31.188 --> 01:55:32.458
Confirmed.

01:55:33.798 --> 01:55:35.663
<i>Good news, boppers.</i>

01:55:35.664 --> 01:55:37.331
We have a sighting.

01:55:38.465 --> 01:55:40.297
<i>Our man in black
has been spotted</i>

01:55:40.298 --> 01:55:42.633
<i>in the</i> septième arrondissement.

01:55:42.634 --> 01:55:46.637
<i>I think it's high time
we paint him red.</i>

01:57:49.159 --> 01:57:53.367
It seems like
our friends at the guild

01:57:53.368 --> 01:57:56.366
<i>and now it's rolling
to the arc de triomphe.</i>

01:57:56.367 --> 01:57:58.373
<i>Let's see who picks it up.</i>

02:00:03.163 --> 02:00:04.728
<i>Come on now, people.</i>

02:00:04.729 --> 02:00:06.897
We're gonna have
to do a lot better.

02:00:10.802 --> 02:00:13.772
<i>Now, who's gonna be
our big winner?</i>

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:42.920
Who is this?

02:02:42.921 --> 02:02:44.553
You know, the question
you should be asking,

02:02:44.554 --> 02:02:46.286
huh, is how much?

02:02:46.287 --> 02:02:48.694
I think we have
the situation under control.

02:02:57.505 --> 02:02:59.470
Because the way I see it,

02:02:59.471 --> 02:03:02.302
<i>is that if Mr. Johnny boy
makes it to the church</i>

02:03:02.303 --> 02:03:05.009
this could be your
last night as Marquis.

02:04:18.147 --> 02:04:20.149
<i>A little traffic update.</i>

02:04:20.150 --> 02:04:23.791
<i>I'm hearing the boys in black
couldn't get it done.</i>

02:04:23.792 --> 02:04:26.693
<i>Our wicked friend
is on the move again.</i>

02:04:26.694 --> 02:04:30.732
He's headed your way,
my listeners of the 8th.

02:06:34.388 --> 02:06:35.389
Yes?

02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:37.852
Fine. You have a deal.

02:06:37.853 --> 02:06:39.726
All right. 35 it is.

02:06:39.727 --> 02:06:42.659
That wasn't our deal.

02:06:47.102 --> 02:06:49.369
Well, that's the only deal
being offered today.

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.155
Get him!

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:23.770
Phone!

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:30.442
What?
Now, you

02:07:30.443 --> 02:07:31.539
<i>Forty.</i>

02:07:32.977 --> 02:07:35.345
You pay for the service.

02:07:48.026 --> 02:07:50.096
<i>Good news, boppers.</i>

02:07:52.327 --> 02:07:54.628
The lottery just went up.

02:12:54.163 --> 02:12:58.205
<i>To all you boppers
still sitting on the side,</i>

02:12:58.206 --> 02:13:01.605
<i>Mr. Wick has
the church in sight.</i>

02:13:03.210 --> 02:13:05.979
<i>We are almost out of time.</i>

02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:08.013
<i>Last chance to win the prize</i>

02:13:08.014 --> 02:13:11.683
<i>before Mr. Wick's last sunrise.</i>

02:13:11.684 --> 02:13:16.422
<i>So who out there is going
to climb those 222 steps?</i>

02:17:55.263 --> 02:17:58.539
It appears Mr. Wick
won't be joining us.

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:18.724
John?

02:18:21.425 --> 02:18:22.761
John?

02:18:24.296 --> 02:18:25.724
Caine.

02:18:25.725 --> 02:18:27.526
What time is sunrise?

02:18:30.632 --> 02:18:31.869
Two...

02:18:33.175 --> 02:18:34.707
Maybe three minutes.

02:18:36.008 --> 02:18:39.239
I need you to get to the top
of those stairs, John.

02:18:43.282 --> 02:18:44.552
Yeah.

02:18:51.653 --> 02:18:52.923
Ready?

02:18:53.556 --> 02:18:54.892
Yeah.

02:19:13.676 --> 02:19:15.077
Twelve or nine?

02:19:16.249 --> 02:19:17.277
Nine.

02:19:50.748 --> 02:19:52.587
Six upstairs. Thanks.

02:21:07.859 --> 02:21:09.393
<i>Ciao, ciao,</i> Mr. Wick.

02:21:22.871 --> 02:21:24.173
You can't shoot me.

02:21:28.284 --> 02:21:29.882
Yeah, you're right.

02:21:30.681 --> 02:21:31.884
But I can shoot him.

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:47.130
But I can hit you, motherfucker.

02:21:48.534 --> 02:21:49.803
Let's go, John.

02:22:15.794 --> 02:22:17.791
Nuts.

02:22:25.539 --> 02:22:27.005
You hit my puppy.

02:22:44.153 --> 02:22:45.353
You know, you owe me.

02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:47.360
Yeah.

02:22:56.033 --> 02:22:57.530
Nothing personal, John.

02:22:58.670 --> 02:23:00.302
We're even now.

02:23:01.343 --> 02:23:02.535
Yeah.

02:23:52.886 --> 02:23:54.961
And so we begin.

02:24:15.284 --> 02:24:19.077
We seek the truth
and will endure

02:24:19.078 --> 02:24:21.548
Consequences.

02:24:41.168 --> 02:24:42.536
Go on now. Come on.

02:25:21.682 --> 02:25:23.082
Positions, gentlemen.

02:25:36.095 --> 02:25:38.559
See you
in the next life, brother.

02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:42.299
Thirty paces.

02:26:30.646 --> 02:26:33.053
Remember
your daughter.

02:26:40.387 --> 02:26:43.294
What a beautiful sunrise.

02:27:02.618 --> 02:27:04.645
Last words, Winston?

02:27:06.017 --> 02:27:07.615
Just have fun out there.

02:27:31.879 --> 02:27:33.740
Are you ready, Mr. Caine?

02:27:40.489 --> 02:27:41.550
Mr. Wick?

02:28:06.242 --> 02:28:07.576
Fire!

02:28:27.867 --> 02:28:29.565
Twenty paces!

02:29:03.605 --> 02:29:04.633
Fire!

02:29:16.519 --> 02:29:17.519
Nice.

02:29:25.055 --> 02:29:26.853
Ten paces!

02:30:17.174 --> 02:30:18.608
Just kill him.

02:30:38.461 --> 02:30:40.663
Those who cling to death,

02:30:42.264 --> 02:30:43.501
live.

02:30:46.237 --> 02:30:48.440
Those who cling to life,

02:30:49.644 --> 02:30:50.739
die.

02:31:00.953 --> 02:31:02.289
Fire!

02:31:41.225 --> 02:31:42.494
As your sponsor,

02:31:44.792 --> 02:31:46.762
I claim the <i>coup de grâce.</i>

02:31:50.535 --> 02:31:52.504
Your weapon, give it to me.

02:31:53.338 --> 02:31:55.001
Is my daughter free now?

02:31:56.376 --> 02:31:58.609
<i>Oui.</i> you
and your daughter.

02:31:59.275 --> 02:32:00.479
Enjoy.

02:32:18.495 --> 02:32:20.026
Rules.
Ha.

02:32:21.763 --> 02:32:24.602
You arrogant asshole,

02:32:25.302 --> 02:32:26.868
he didn't shoot.

02:32:28.074 --> 02:32:29.508
Consequences.

02:32:45.586 --> 02:32:47.394
That's fucking good.

02:32:59.433 --> 02:33:00.770
Hmm.

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:10.549
Your obligation to the table...

02:33:12.253 --> 02:33:14.413
Is satisfied, John wick.

02:33:14.414 --> 02:33:15.686
You are free.

02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:23.155
As are you
and your daughter, sir.

02:33:25.997 --> 02:33:28.963
You will be
fully reinstated,

02:33:30.269 --> 02:33:31.669
All of your terms

02:33:33.008 --> 02:33:34.705
will be fulfilled.

02:33:40.548 --> 02:33:43.642
Our business here now
is concluded.

02:33:43.643 --> 02:33:45.683
Good day.

02:34:26.423 --> 02:34:27.626
My brother.

02:34:30.933 --> 02:34:32.526
You owe me one.

02:34:35.167 --> 02:34:36.228
Yeah.

02:34:58.827 --> 02:34:59.955
Winston.

02:35:00.962 --> 02:35:02.155
Jonathan.

02:35:04.759 --> 02:35:06.632
Will you take me home?

02:35:13.601 --> 02:35:14.970
Of course.

02:36:48.564 --> 02:36:49.834
Helen.

02:37:51.466 --> 02:37:53.733
Never thought I'd see the day.

02:37:59.069 --> 02:38:02.038
Where do you think he is,
heaven or hell?

02:38:07.742 --> 02:38:09.111
